## 5. Recommendations

### 1. **Expand Customer Acquisition**
- **Action**: Implement referral program leveraging existing high-value customers
- **Rationale**: 100% of revenue comes from just 3 customers; company needs broader customer base
- **Target**: Aim for 50% new customer revenue within 6 months

### 2. **Optimize B2B Operations**
- **Action**: Develop dedicated B2B portal with bulk pricing, PO processing, and corporate shipping options
- **Rationale**: B2B customers generate 76% of revenue ($11,195) with higher AOV and bulk orders
- **Target**: Reduce B2B order processing time by 50% and increase average B2B order size by 25%

### 3. **Improve Order Fulfillment Quality**
- **Action**: Implement pre-shipment quality checks and enhanced product description/visualization
- **Rationale**: 20% of orders have issues (cancellations, returns) often due to incorrect expectations or better pricing elsewhere
- **Target**: Reduce order issues to under 10% and implement price-matching policy for premium customers

**Additional Quick Win**: Create product bundles based on Alice's purchasing patterns (headphones + keyboard, watch + chair for home office) to increase AOV across customer segments.
