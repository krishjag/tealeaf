## How This Data Was Produced

The JSON file was generated by downloading JOLTS flat files from the BLS
public FTP server and processing them with the included `process_jolts.py` script.

### Steps

1. The script downloads tab-separated flat files from:
   `https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/jt/`

2. The JOLTS program produces monthly estimates of job openings, hires, and
   separations (quits, layoffs/discharges, other) from a sample of ~16,000
   nonfarm establishments across the US. Estimates are derived from the
   Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) universe of ~9 million
   establishments. BLS publishes both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted
   series, at both level (thousands) and rate (percent of employment).

3. The script loads three BLS flat files:
   - `jt.series` — series definitions (encodes industry, element, seasonal, etc.)
   - `jt.industry` — industry lookup (NAICS-based codes and names)
   - `jt.data.0.Current` — recent time series observations

4. It filters to:
   - A single year of monthly data (default: 2025)
   - National level, seasonally adjusted, all size classes
   - 12 industries spanning the NAICS hierarchy
   - 6 data elements (job openings, hires, quits, layoffs, total/other separations)
   - Both levels (thousands) and rates (percent)

5. The output is hierarchically structured JSON: industries contain nested
   monthly data arrays, each month containing 6 element objects with level/rate pairs.

### Reproducing

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install polars requests

# Generate with default settings (2025, 12 industries)
python process_jolts.py

# Generate for a different year
python process_jolts.py --year 2024

# Limit to fewer industries
python process_jolts.py --limit 8
```

### Output Schema

The output is a JSON object with metadata at the top level and a nested `industries` array:

```

**`data_elements`** — 6 JOLTS measures (uniform 4-field objects):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Element code (JO, HI, TS, QU, LD, OS) |
| `key` | string | JSON field name (e.g., `job_openings`, `quits`) |
| `name` | string | Human-readable name |
| `description` | string | Brief description |

**`industries`** — NAICS-based industry sectors with nested monthly data:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `code` | string | 6-digit industry code |
| `name` | string | Industry name |
| `hierarchy_level` | int | Depth (0=total, 1=supersector, 2=sector, 3=subsector) |
| `monthly_data` | array | 12 monthly records |

**`monthly_data[]`** — Per-month record with 6 element objects:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `month` | int | Month number (1-12) |
| `month_name` | string | Month name |
| `job_openings` | object | `{level, rate}` — unfilled positions |
| `hires` | object | `{level, rate}` — workers added to payroll |
| `total_separations` | object | `{level, rate}` — all workers who left |
| `quits` | object | `{level, rate}` — voluntary departures |
| `layoffs_discharges` | object | `{level, rate}` — involuntary separations |
| `other_separations` | object | `{level, rate}` — retirements, transfers, etc. |

Each element object contains `level` (thousands) and `rate` (percent of employment).

This nested structure produces 9 TeaLeaf schemas: 6 element structs (each with `level` + `rate`), a `monthly_data` struct, an `industry` struct, and a `data_element` struct.
