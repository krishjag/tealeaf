Perform the following calculations and analysis:
1. Using population and adult_population from each county, calculate the percentage of residents who are adults (18+)
2. For each county, compute a composite "chronic disease burden" score: average the prevalence values for ARTHRITIS, BPHIGH, DIABETES, CHD, COPD, and STROKE
3. Rank all 10 counties by their chronic disease burden score
4. For disability measures (category DISABLT), calculate the average disability prevalence per county and identify which county has the highest disability burden
5. Compare preventive service utilization (category PREVENT): which county has the highest dental visit rate (DENTAL)? The highest mammography rate (MAMMOUSE)? The highest cholesterol screening rate (CHOLSCREEN)?
6. Calculate the population-weighted average for obesity (OBESITY) across all 10 counties (weight by adult_population)
7. For each category, identify the single measure with the highest overall average prevalence across all counties
