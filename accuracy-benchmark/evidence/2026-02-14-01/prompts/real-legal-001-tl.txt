Perform the following calculations and analysis:
1. Calculate the total time from offense date to sentencing date. How many years and months elapsed?
2. For each charge, extract the sentence components: prison time and extended supervision time. What is the total combined incarceration (prison + ES) for each charge? Are the sentences concurrent or consecutive?
3. How many defense attorneys represented the defendant? Calculate the duration (in months) each attorney was on the case
4. Count the total docket entries per year (2016-2025). Which year had the most activity?
5. How many docket entries are related to appeals (Court of Appeals or Supreme Court references)? What percentage of total docket entries are appeal-related?
6. From the receivables, calculate: total amount due, total paid, remaining balance, and what percentage has been collected
7. The bond was set at what amount? Identify the bond-related docket entries and their dates
