Both charges filed via Information on August 10, 2016:
- **Charge 1:** Battery by Prisoners, §940.20(1), Felony H
- **Charge 2:** Disorderly Conduct, §947.01(1), Misdemeanor B

### Final Charges with Enhancers
**No charges were added or dropped**, but significant **modifiers were applied**:

**Charge 1 - Battery by Prisoners:**
- **Modifier 1:** §939.62(1)(b) - **Repeater** (felony-level enhancer)
- **Modifier 2:** §939.63(1)(b) - **Use of a Dangerous Weapon**
- Final Disposition: **Found Guilty at Jury Trial** (December 4, 2019)

**Charge 2 - Disorderly Conduct:**
- **Modifier 1:** §939.62(1)(a) - **Repeater** (misdemeanor-level enhancer)
- **Note:** Judgment indicates "With use of a dangerous weapon enhancer dismissed"
- Final Disposition: **Found Guilty at Jury Trial** (December 4, 2019)

**Key Findings:** The prosecution successfully added repeater enhancements to both charges. The dangerous weapon enhancer was proven for Charge 1 but dismissed for Charge 2, suggesting strategic charging and/or evidentiary limitations.

### SENTENCING COMPARISON

## 5. HABEAS CORPUS ACTIVITY ANALYSIS

### COMPREHENSIVE WRIT COUNT

I identified **24 separate habeas corpus petitions/writs** filed throughout this case:

#### Pre-Trial Phase (2016):
1. 02/16/2016 - For 2/25/16 hearing
2. 02/16/2016 - For 2/18/16 hearing
3. 02/24/2016 - For 3/3/16 hearing

11. 02/23/2018 - Writ issued (1 of 2)
12. 02/23/2018 - Writ issued (2 of 2)

#### Post-Conviction Hearings (2021):
18. 08/16/2021 - Petition for 9/10/21 (Green Bay Correctional)
19. 08/16/2021 - Petition for 9/10/21 (Wisconsin Secure Program Facility)
20. 08/17/2021 - Writ issued (WSPF)
21. 08/17/2021 - Writ issued (Green Bay)
22. 10/27/2021 - Petition for 11/29/21
23. 11/02/2021 - Writ for 11/29/21 (Green Bay)

### FACILITY MOVEMENT PATTERN

The habeas corpus activity reveals defendant's movement through Wisconsin's correctional system:

1. **Waupun Correctional Institution** (Initial appearance, early proceedings)
   - Address: 200 S Madison Street PO Box 351, Waupun, WI 53963
   
2. **Green Bay Correctional Institution** (Mid-case)
   - Address change: 07/21/2016
   - Address: PO Box 19033, Green Bay, WI 54307
   
3. **Wisconsin Secure Program Facility** (Post-conviction phase)
   - Address change: 11/29/2022
   - Address: P.O. Box 100, Boscobel, WI 53805

### WHAT THIS PATTERN SUGGESTS

1. **Continuous Incarceration:** Defendant was serving a sentence on another case throughout these proceedings (consistent with "consecutive to any other sentence" language)

2. **Video Conferencing:** Many entries note "appeared via video" or "video conferencing," reducing but not eliminating need for physical transport

3. **Security Level Changes:** Movement from Waupun → Green Bay → Wisconsin Secure Program Facility suggests possible changes in security classification (WSPF is a maximum-security facility)

4. **Administrative Burden:** Each court appearance required coordination between:
   - Circuit court
   - Correctional institution
   - Transportation/security personnel
   - Court security

5. **Standard Procedure:** The high number of writs is **normal** for an incarcerated defendant with a case spanning nearly 10 years with multiple court appearances

6. **Jurisdictional Issues:** Dual petitions in August 2021 (for both Green Bay and WSPF) suggest uncertainty about defendant's location, possibly during a transfer

Supreme Court (2024-2025)    | ~4           | Extensions, briefs
-----------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------
TOTAL                        | 38+          |
```

### HIGHEST MOTION ACTIVITY PHASE

**POST-CONVICTION & APPELLATE PHASE (2020-2025)** had the highest motion activity:
- **23+ motions filed** (60% of all motion activity)
- Predominantly **motions to extend time**
- Reflects complexity of:
  - Transcript preparation (10+ transcripts ordered)
  - Record compilation
  - Appellate briefing
  - Remand proceedings
  - Multiple levels of review

### MOST COMMON MOTION TYPES (Overall)

1. **Motions to Extend Time** (15+) - 40% of all motions
2. **Scheduling/Continuance Motions** (8+) - 21%
3. **Discovery Motions** (4) - 11%
4. **Dispositive Motions** (3) - 8%
5. **Motions in Limine** (2+) - 5%
6. **Other** (6+) - 16%

### KEY FINDINGS

1. **Delay Pattern:** The extraordinary number of continuances (6 trial resets) is unusual and directly led to the successful speedy trial claim

2. **Extension Requests:** Post-conviction phase saw routine granting of time extensions, suggesting:
   - Complexity of record
   - Overburdened appellate counsel
   - Court willingness to accommodate thorough briefing

3. **Strategic Persistence:** Defense filed speedy trial motion in 2019 (pre-trial), raised it post-conviction, and ultimately succeeded on appeal

4. **Appellate Remand:** The Court of Appeals' decision to remand for supplemental motion (rather than decide immediately) added 6+ months but ensured thorough record

## CONCLUSION

This case represents a **decade-long criminal justice odyssey** marked by:
- Extreme pre-trial delay (3+ years after arraignment)
- Persistent defense advocacy on speedy trial grounds
- Ultimate vindication at the appellate level
- Incarceration throughout proceedings on separate sentence
- Multi-tier appellate review reaching Wisconsin Supreme Court

**The defendant's speedy trial rights were ultimately vindicated after 10 years of litigation, despite two denials by the circuit court.** The case demonstrates both the protections afforded by the Sixth Amendment and the extraordinary time required to enforce those protections through the appellate process.

**Final Status:** Case dismissed per Court of Appeals mandate, affirmed by Supreme Court. All charges vacated. Case closed October 2, 2025.
