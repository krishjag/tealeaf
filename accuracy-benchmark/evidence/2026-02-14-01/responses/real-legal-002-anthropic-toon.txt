# Comprehensive Criminal Case Analysis: State v. Luis A. Ramirez

## 1. CHARGE PROGRESSION ANALYSIS

### Original vs. Final Charges

**No charges were added or dropped** - both original charges remained through conviction:

| Charge | Description | Statute | Severity | Status |
|--------|-------------|---------|----------|--------|
| Count 1 | Battery by Prisoners | 940.20(1) | Felony H | Guilty at Jury Trial |
| Count 2 | Disorderly Conduct | 947.01(1) | Misd. B | Guilty at Jury Trial |

### Charge Modifiers (Enhancers)

**Count 1 - Battery by Prisoners:**
- **Modifier 1:** 939.62(1)(b) - **Repeater** (habitual criminality enhancer)
- **Modifier 2:** 939.63(1)(b) - **Use of a Dangerous Weapon** (penalty enhancer)
- Both enhancers were proven at trial and applied at sentencing

**Count 2 - Disorderly Conduct:**
- **Modifier 1:** 939.62(1)(a) - **Repeater** (misdemeanor repeater)
- **Notable:** The disposition notes indicate "With use of a dangerous weapon enhancer dismissed" - suggesting this enhancer was initially charged but not proven or was dismissed at sentencing

### Statutory Framework
- **939.62** - Increased penalty for habitual criminals
- **939.63** - Penalties for use of dangerous weapon - significantly increases maximum sentences

## 5. HABEAS CORPUS ACTIVITY ANALYSIS

### Complete Writ Inventory

I identified **24 separate habeas corpus petitions/writs** throughout the case:

#### Pre-Trial Phase (2016-2019): 14 Writs

| Date Filed | Date Issued | Purpose | Facility |
|------------|-------------|---------|----------|
| 2/16/2016 | 2/16/2016 | Preliminary hearing 2/25/16 | Waupun Correctional |
| 2/16/2016 | 2/16/2016 | Hearing 2/18/16 | Waupun Correctional |
| 2/24/2016 | - | Hearing 3/3/16 | Waupun Correctional |
| 3/14/2016 | - | Return date 5/10/16 | Waupun Correctional |
| 6/8/2016 | - | Return date 7/20/16 | Waupun Correctional |
| 7/22/2016 | - | Preliminary hearing 8/4/16 | Green Bay Correctional |
| 8/10/2016 | - | Arraignment 10/24/16 | Green Bay Correctional |
| 8/17/2016 | - | Arraignment 10/26/16 | Green Bay Correctional |
| 2/22/2018 (×2) | 2/23/2018 (×2) | Trial prep 4/4/18 | Green Bay Correctional |
| 12/2/2019 | 12/2/2019 | Jury trial 12/3/19 | Green Bay Correctional |
| 12/17/2019 | 12/18/2019 | Sentencing 2/24/20 | Green Bay Correctional |
| 2/17/2020 | 2/20/2020 | Sentencing 2/24/20 | Green Bay Correctional |

#### Post-Conviction Phase (2021): 10 Writs

| Date Filed | Date Issued | Purpose | Facility |
|------------|-------------|---------|----------|
| 8/16/2021 (×2) | 8/17/2021 (×2) | Evidentiary hearing 9/10/21 | Green Bay CI + WSPF |
| 10/27/2021 | 11/2/2021 | Evidentiary hearing 11/29/21 | Green Bay Correctional |

**Note:** Dual petitions on 8/16/2021 reflect defendant transfer between facilities during proceedings.

### Pattern Analysis

**1. Frequency Distribution:**
- **Pre-trial/Trial Phase:** 14 writs (2016-2020) = ~3.5 per year
- **Post-conviction Phase:** 10 writs (2021) = 10 in one year
- **Total:** 24 writs over 5 years of active litigation

**2. Facility Tracking:**
Writs reveal defendant's movement through Wisconsin DOC system:
- **Waupun Correctional Institution** (2016 - early)
- **Green Bay Correctional Institution** (mid-2016 - 2021)
  - Address change documented 7/21/2016
- **Wisconsin Secure Program Facility (Boscobel)** (2021-2025)
  - Address change documented 11/29/2022
  - WSPF is a maximum-security facility

**3. Administrative Burden:**
Each writ requires:
- Petition preparation by prosecutor's office
- Proposed order drafting
- Judge's signature
- Service to DOC facility
- DOC coordination for transport
- Security arrangements
- Video conference setup (in later proceedings)

**4. What This Pattern Suggests:**

**a) Continuous Incarceration:** Defendant was incarcerated for the entirety of proceedings, serving a separate sentence during prosecution of this case (explains "consecutive to any other sentence" language)

**b) Litigation Intensity:** The high volume of writs correlates with:
- Multiple trial continuances (each requiring new writ)
- Active post-conviction litigation requiring in-person testimony
- Defendant's engagement in his defense

**c) Resource Allocation:** 
- Significant prosecutorial resources devoted to coordination
- DOC resources for transport/video conferencing
- Court resources for securing defendant's presence

**d) Constitutional Compliance:** Pattern demonstrates courts' commitment to defendant's Sixth Amendment confrontation rights and due process despite logistical challenges

**e) Case Complexity:** The need for defendant's physical/virtual presence at 24+ proceedings indicates this was not a routine case - multiple evidentiary hearings, motion arguments, and trial proceedings required defendant's participation

## 6. MOTION PRACTICE ANALYSIS

### Motion Inventory by Type and Phase

#### **Phase 1: Discovery & Pre-Trial (2016-2017)**

**Discovery Motions:**
- 3/15/2016: Demand for discovery + Petition for leave to file additional motions (Defense)
- 3/28/2016: Motion and demand for discovery + Notice of DNA and witness list (State)

- 3/6/2017: Scheduling conference set
- 8/4/2017: Letter re: jury trial scheduling conflict

#### **Phase 3: Speedy Trial Litigation (2018-2019)**

**Constitutional Motions:**
- 9/26/2018: **Demand for Speedy Trial** (Defense) - **CRITICAL MOTION**

**Motion Activity: HIGH** (constitutional challenges emerge)

#### **Phase 4: Trial (December 2019)**

**Trial Motions:**
- 12/4/2019: Motion for judgment on verdicts (State) - granted immediately after guilty verdict

**Motion Activity: Low** (trial proceeded smoothly once underway)

#### **Phase 5: Post-Conviction Relief (2020-2023)**

**Extension Motions (Appellate):**
- 6/11/2020: Motion to extend time for appointing counsel (granted)
- 10/21/2020: Motion to extend time for filing postconviction motion (granted)

- 10/28/2022: **Defendant's Supplemental Postconviction Motion/Motion to Reconsider**

**Motion Activity: EXTREMELY HIGH** (~15+ motions, mostly procedural extensions)

### Motion Success Rate Analysis

| Motion Type | Filed By | Outcome | Strategic Impact |
|-------------|----------|---------|------------------|
| Discovery demands | Both parties | Granted (routine) | Case preparation |
| Continuance motions | Defense (mostly) | Granted | **Delayed trial 37 months** |
| Speedy trial demand | Defense | Initially ignored | Became basis for reversal |
| Motion to dismiss | Defense | **DENIED** (2019) | Presaged appeal issue |
| Postconviction motion | Defense | **DENIED** (2022) | Led to appeal |
| Supplemental PC motion | Defense | **DENIED** (2023) | Exhausted remedies |
| Appeal | Defense | **GRANTED** (2024) | **Complete reversal** |

### Frequency Analysis by Year

```
2016: ████████ (8 motions) - Discovery, scheduling
2017: ████████████ (12 motions) - Continuances dominate
2018: ██████████ (10 motions) - Speedy trial issues emerge
2019: ████████ (8 motions) - Trial preparation, dismissal motion
2020: ████ (4 motions) - Post-conviction begins
2021: ██████████████ (14 motions) - Post-conviction high activity
2022: ████████████ (12 motions) - Appeal + supplemental motions
2023: ████ (4 motions) - Final circuit court proceedings
```

### Pattern Observations

**1. Continuance Cascade (2017-2018):**
The case experienced a **"continuance spiral"** where:
- Witness unavailability → reset
- Attorney scheduling conflict → reset  
- Underestimated trial length (1 day vs. 3 days needed) → reset
- State discovery issues → reset

This created the very delay that ultimately led to reversal on speedy trial grounds - **ironic outcome**.

**2. Extension Motion Proliferation (2020-2021):**
The pattern of **10+ extension motions** in post-conviction phase suggests:
- Case complexity requiring extensive transcript review
- Attorney workload (State Public Defender Appellate Division)
- Court of Appeals' flexibility with deadlines
- Systemic acceptance of delayed appellate review

**3. Strategic Motion Timing:**
Defense filed **Speedy Trial Demand on 9/26/2018** - exactly **1,239 days after charges filed** (2/1/2016). This documented the delay and preserved the issue for appeal.

**4. Motion-to-Hearing Lag:**
Average time from motion filing to hearing:
- Routine matters: 2-4 weeks
- Substantive motions: 1-3 months  
- Post-conviction motions: 3-6 months

**5. Most Significant Motion:**
The **6/21/2021 Postconviction Motion to Vacate for Speedy Trial Violation** ultimately succeeded after:
- Circuit court denial (5/13/2022)
- Court of Appeals remand (9/30/2022)
- Supplemental motion and denial (5/16/2023)
- Court of Appeals reversal (4/25/2024)

**The motion took 3 years to succeed through appellate process.**

## MOST SIGNIFICANT PROCEDURAL EVENTS

### 1. **September 26, 2018 - Speedy Trial Demand**
The defendant's formal demand for speedy trial, filed 967 days after charges, documented the excessive delay and preserved the constitutional issue that ultimately led to reversal.

### 2. **December 3-4, 2019 - Jury Trial (1,401 days post-filing)**
The trial itself—occurring nearly 4 years after charges—demonstrated the very violation that would later be found unconstitutional. The 47-minute jury deliberation and unanimous guilty verdicts on both counts appeared to secure conviction.

### 3. **June 21, 2021 - Post-Conviction Motion Filed**
Attorney Lohr's comprehensive motion attacking the speedy trial violation initiated the successful appellate challenge, despite initial circuit court denial.

### 4. **September 30, 2022 - Court of Appeals Sua Sponte Remand**
The Court of Appeals' decision to remand for supplemental briefing (rather than simply affirming denial) signaled the appellate court's serious concern about the delay and foreshadowed eventual reversal.

### 5. **April 25, 2024 - Court of Appeals Reversal**
The complete reversal with instructions to dismiss—rather than remand for new trial—represented total vindication of defendant's speedy trial claim and effectively ended the prosecution after 9+ years.

### 6. **June 27, 2025 - Supreme Court Final Decision**
Whatever the specific holding, this decision provided the final word on Wisconsin's application of speedy trial rights in cases involving incarcerated defendants with multiple pending charges.

## CONCLUSION

This case exemplifies the tension between thorough prosecution of in-custody defendants and constitutional speedy trial protections. The irony is stark: the State's multiple continuance requests and scheduling accommodations—likely intended to ensure a fair and well-prepared trial—created the very delay that ultimately invalidated the conviction. The case consumed enormous judicial resources (24 habeas writs, 6 trial settings, 231 docket entries, multiple appellate proceedings) only to result in dismissal nearly a decade after the offense.

The defendant, already serving another sentence, obtained post-conviction relief through persistent appellate advocacy across three levels of Wisconsin courts, transforming what appeared to be a straightforward conviction into a precedential speedy trial case.
