**Finding:** CWE-416 (Use After Free) has the highest average severity at 7.80, representing critical memory safety issues.

## 4. Attack Vector Analysis

| Attack Vector | Count | Percentage |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| **LOCAL** | 39 | 97.5% |
| **NETWORK** | 1 | 2.5% |
| **ADJACENT_NETWORK** | 0 | 0% |
| **PHYSICAL** | 0 | 0% |

**Finding:** 97.5% require local access, only 2.5% are remotely exploitable via network.

## 5. Version Range Analysis (Broadest Impact)

**CVE with Broadest Kernel Version Range:**

**CVE-2023-52507** (nfc: nci: assert requested protocol is valid)
- Affects kernel versions: **3.2 to 6.6-rc5**
- Span: ~3.4 major versions (approximately 8+ years)

Other notable broad-impact CVEs:
- **CVE-2022-48627**: 3.7 to 6.5.6
- **CVE-2023-52522**: 2.6.37 to 6.5.7

## 6. Exploitability vs Impact Scores

**Average Scores:**
- **Exploitability Score:** 1.86
- **Impact Score:** 4.11
- **Impact/Exploitability Ratio:** 2.21:1

**Finding:** Impact scores are more than double exploitability scores, indicating these vulnerabilities cause significant damage but are moderately difficult to exploit (primarily requiring local access).

## 7. Reference Tag Analysis

**Reference Tags by Frequency:**
- **Patch:** 238 references across all CVEs (100% of CVEs have at least one Patch reference)
- **Mailing List:** 2 references (5% of CVEs)
- **Vendor Advisory:** 0 references (0%)

**Patch Coverage:** 
- **100%** of CVEs have patch references
- Average of **5.95 patch references per CVE**
- Most patches link to git.kernel.org/stable/

**Key Finding:** Excellent patch availability with all vulnerabilities having documented fixes in the kernel stable tree, demonstrating rapid response to security issues.

## Summary Insights

1. **Severity Profile:** Predominantly MEDIUM severity (70%), with LOCAL attack vector (97.5%)
2. **Primary Concerns:** Use-after-free bugs (CWE-416) represent the most severe vulnerability class
3. **Remediation:** Universal patch availability indicates strong security maintenance
4. **Impact:** Long kernel version ranges affected (some spanning 8+ years) highlight importance of timely updates
5. **Attack Surface:** Low network exposure but significant local privilege escalation risk
