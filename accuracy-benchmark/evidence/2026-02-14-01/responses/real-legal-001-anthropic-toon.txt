## 2. Sentence Structure Analysis

### Charge 1: Battery by Prisoners (Felony H)
- **Initial Confinement:** 12 years
- **Extended Supervision:** 3 years
- **Total:** **15 years**
- **Structure:** CONSECUTIVE to any other sentence currently serving

### Charge 2: Disorderly Conduct (Misd. B)
- **Initial Confinement:** 1 year
- **Extended Supervision:** 6 months
- **Total:** 1.5 years
- **Structure:** CONCURRENT with Count 1

### Combined Sentence Analysis:
Since Count 2 runs **concurrent** with Count 1, the **effective total sentence is 15 years** (12 years prison + 3 years extended supervision). However, this entire sentence runs **consecutive** to any other sentence the defendant was already serving at the time.

## Notable Case Observations:

1. **Speedy Trial Issue:** The 4+ year delay from offense to trial became grounds for appeal, ultimately resulting in the Court of Appeals reversing the conviction in 2024.

2. **Extended Litigation:** The case remained active for **9+ years** (2016-2025), with post-conviction proceedings lasting longer than the trial phase.

3. **Incarceration Status:** Defendant appeared from custody throughout (Waupun, Green Bay Correctional, Wisconsin Secure Program Facility), indicating he was serving another sentence during these proceedings.

4. **Ultimate Outcome:** Based on the 2024 Court of Appeals reversal and subsequent Supreme Court involvement, the case's final disposition appears to involve potential dismissal or significant modification of the conviction.
