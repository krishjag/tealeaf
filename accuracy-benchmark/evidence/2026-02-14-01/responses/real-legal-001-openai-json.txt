### 6) Receivables calculations (amount due/paid/balance/% collected)

From `receivables[0]`:
- **Total amount due:** 761.00  
- **Total paid:** 352.00  
- **Remaining balance:** 0.00 (WCCA shows `balanceDue: 0.0`)  
- **AmountDue vs Paid collection rate:** 352 / 761 ≈ **46.3%**

**Answer (as displayed in receivable fields):**
- **Amount due:** $761.00  
- **Paid:** $352.00  
- **Balance due:** $0.00  
- **% collected (paid ÷ amount due):** **46.3%**

*(Note: the combination “paid $352” and “balance due $0” implies the remainder was satisfied via something other than “paid” as captured here (e.g., adjustment/other accounting), but `adjust` is shown as 0.00 in this extract.)*
