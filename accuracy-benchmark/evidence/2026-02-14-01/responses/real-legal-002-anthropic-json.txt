# Comprehensive Analysis: State of Wisconsin v. Luis A Ramirez #244212

## 1. CHARGE PROGRESSION ANALYSIS

**Original vs. Final Charges:**
The charges remained **consistent** from complaint through conviction:

| Charge | Offense | Statute | Severity |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| Count 1 | Battery by Prisoners | 940.20(1) | Felony H |
| Count 2 | Disorderly Conduct | 947.01(1) | Misd. B |

**Charge Modifiers (Enhancers):**

**Count 1 - Battery by Prisoners:**
- **Repeater Enhancement**: §939.62(1)(b) - Increases penalties for defendants with prior felony convictions
- **Dangerous Weapon Enhancement**: §939.63(1)(b) - Increases penalties when dangerous weapon used

**Count 2 - Disorderly Conduct:**
- **Repeater Enhancement**: §939.62(1)(a) - Misdemeanor-level repeater
- **Note**: Dangerous weapon enhancer was **dismissed** at conviction (per disposition description: "With use of a dangerous weapon enhancer dismissed")

**Key Finding**: The weapon used (a pencil, per exhibit evidence) qualified as a dangerous weapon for the battery charge but was dismissed for the disorderly conduct charge.

- **Specific Conditions**:
  - "Same conditions as Ct. 1"
  - Costs: $243.00

### Comparative Analysis:

|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Confinement Structure** | Consecutive | Concurrent |

## 5. HABEAS CORPUS ACTIVITY ANALYSIS

### Comprehensive Writ Count:

| Date | Number of Writs | Purpose/Destination |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| 2016-02-16 | 2 | Preliminary hearings (2/18/16 and 2/25/16) |
| 2016-02-24 | 1 | March 3, 2016 hearing |
| 2016-03-14 | 1 | May 10, 2016 return date from Waupun |
| 2016-06-08 | 1 | July 20, 2016 return date |
| 2016-07-22 | 1 | August 4, 2016 preliminary hearing |
| 2018-02-22-23 | 2 | April 2018 trial dates |
| 2019-12-02 | 1 | December 3-4, 2019 trial |
| 2019-12-17-18 | 2 | February 24, 2020 sentencing |
| 2020-02-17-20 | 2 | Sentencing hearing |
| 2021-08-16-17 | 2 | September 10, 2021 evidentiary hearing (Green Bay CI and WSPF) |
| 2021-11-02 | 1 | November 29, 2021 evidentiary hearing |

**Total Writs Filed: Approximately 18-20**

### Institutional Movement:

The defendant's addresses throughout the case reveal his custody location:
1. **Waupun Correctional Institution** (initial)
2. **Green Bay Correctional Institution** (2016-07-21 through ~2022)
3. **Wisconsin Secure Program Facility (Boscobel)** (2022-11-29 to present)

### Analysis & Implications:

**Pattern Significance:**
1. **Continuous Incarceration**: The high frequency of habeas corpus writs confirms the defendant was **never released on bond** despite the $5,000 signature bond set at initial appearance. He remained in custody on other sentences throughout.

2. **Administrative Burden**: Each court appearance required:
   - Petition for writ filed by DA's office
   - Proposed order
   - Judge's signature
   - Service on institution
   - Coordination with DOC transport

3. **Video Conferencing Shift**: Later entries show increased use of "video conferencing" (2019, 2021-2023), reducing need for physical transport writs.

4. **Post-Conviction Litigation**: The pattern continued through post-conviction proceedings, indicating the defendant remained incarcerated during the entire appellate process.

5. **Security Level**: Transfer to Wisconsin Secure Program Facility (WSPF) in November 2022 suggests **maximum security classification**—WSPF is Wisconsin's highest security prison.

**Key Finding**: The habeas corpus pattern reveals this was a **"prison within prison" case**—the defendant was prosecuted for a crime (battery) committed **while already incarcerated** at Columbia Correctional Institution on May 5, 2015, and remained in custody throughout 10 years of litigation.

------------------------|---------------|-------------
Pre-Trial (2016-2019)   |     ~8-10     |  High (most continuances granted)

```

3. **Continuance/Reset Motions (6+)**: Throughout pre-trial
4. **Substantive Relief Motions (3)**: Dismissal, PCM, Supplemental PCM

### Highest Motion Activity Period:

**POST-CONVICTION PHASE (2020-2023)**

**Reasoning:**
- Multiple substantive post-conviction motions with extensive briefing
- Constant need for extensions due to:
  - Transcript preparation delays
  - Counsel workload (State Public Defender office)
  - Complexity of speedy trial analysis
  - Court of Appeals remand requiring supplemental motion
- Evidentiary hearing on 11-29-2021 requiring additional briefing

**Case Management Issues:**
The motion record reveals significant delay factors:
- 3+ years from complaint to trial (2016-2019)
- Multiple trial resets (at least 5 documented)
- Defendant's speedy trial demand in 2018 went unanswered for over a year
- Post-conviction proceedings took longer than the original prosecution (2020-2025 vs. 2016-2020)

## **FINAL CASE OUTCOME**

Based on the docket entries, the **defendant appears to have ultimately prevailed**:

✓ Court of Appeals **reversed** the conviction  
✓ Circuit court ordered to **dismiss** the complaint  
✓ Supreme Court review completed with remittitur issued  
✓ Case **closed** as of October 2, 2025  
✓ Financial obligations ($761) shown as **$0.00 balance due**

**The speedy trial violation claim—first asserted in September 2018—was vindicated after 7 years of litigation, resulting in reversal of both convictions and dismissal of the charges.**

This case serves as a stark illustration of how **pre-trial delay**, even in cases that result in conviction, can constitute a constitutional violation warranting reversal years after sentencing.
