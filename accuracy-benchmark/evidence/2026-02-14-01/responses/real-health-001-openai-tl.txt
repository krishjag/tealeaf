## 4) King (urban) vs Ferry (rural): selected indicators
(All values are crude prevalence % with 95% CI)

| Measure | King | Ferry | Difference (Ferry − King) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Smoking (CSMOKING)** | 7.2 (5.8–8.9) | 16.0 (13.5–19.0) | **+8.8** |
| **Obesity (OBESITY)** | 22.6 (20.4–24.9) | 40.2 (33.4–47.9) | **+17.6** |
| **Depression (DEPRESSION)** | 23.5 (21.7–25.3) | 25.0 (21.7–28.8) | +1.5 |
| **No health insurance (ACCESS2)** | 6.8 (5.5–8.4) | 8.5 (6.9–10.4) | +1.7 |

Key pattern: Ferry is substantially higher on **smoking** and **obesity**, modestly higher on **uninsurance**, and slightly higher on **depression**.

## 5) Widest disparity among **Health Risk Behaviors (RISKBEH)**
Risk behaviors included: **BINGE, CSMOKING, LPA, SLEEP**.

Computed range (max − min) across the 10 counties:
- **Short sleep (SLEEP):** max **37.0** (Pierce) − min **29.0** (King/Island) = **8.0 pp**
- **Physical inactivity (LPA):** max **27.9** (Yakima) − min **13.9** (King) = **14.0 pp**  ← **widest**
- **Smoking (CSMOKING):** max **16.0** (Ferry) − min **7.2** (King) = **8.8 pp**
- **Binge drinking (BINGE):** max **17.9** (Whatcom) − min **14.0** (Ferry) = **3.9 pp**

**Answer:** **Physical inactivity (LPA)** shows the widest disparity (**14.0 percentage points**).

## 6) Counties where **>3 health outcomes** exceed the 10-county average by **≥5 percentage points**
Method: for each HLTHOUT measure, compute the 10-county mean (simple average of county prevalences), then flag county-measure pairs where county value ≥ (mean + 5). Identify counties with **more than 3** such flagged outcomes.

### 10-county HLTHOUT means (for reference; %)
ARTHRITIS 26.8; BPHIGH 32.7; CANCER 8.9; CASTHMA 11.0; CHD 6.3; COPD 6.0; DEPRESSION 25.1; DIABETES 10.8; HIGHCHOL 35.8; OBESITY 33.8; STROKE 3.4; TEETHLOST 10.7.

### Results
- **Ferry County** is the **only** county with **>3** HLTHOUT measures ≥ mean+5:
  - **Arthritis:** 38.0 vs 26.8 (↑11.2)
  - **High blood pressure:** 41.1 vs 32.7 (↑8.4)
  - **CHD:** 10.0 vs 6.3 (↑3.7) *(not ≥5; exclude)*
  - **COPD:** 9.8 vs 6.0 (↑3.8) *(exclude)*
  - **Diabetes:** 15.1 vs 10.8 (↑4.3) *(exclude)*
  - **High cholesterol:** 41.2 vs 35.8 (↑5.4)
  - **Obesity:** 40.2 vs 33.8 (↑6.4)
  - **Stroke:** 5.2 vs 3.4 (↑1.8) *(exclude)*
  - **Cancer:** 11.4 vs 8.9 (↑2.5) *(exclude)*
  - **Teeth lost:** 13.7 vs 10.7 (↑3.0) *(exclude)*

  **Flagged (≥+5): Arthritis, High BP, High Cholesterol, Obesity = 4 measures.**

- **No other county** exceeds the threshold on **more than 3** HLTHOUT measures.
  - Notable near-misses:
    - **Yakima** exceeds mean+5 for **GHLTH is not HLTHOUT**; within HLTHOUT it clearly exceeds for **obesity** (+5.9) and **teeth lost** (+6.5), but not enough additional measures to reach >3.
    - **King** is generally below the mean on multiple HLTHOUT measures (not an exceedance pattern).

If you want, I can also provide (a) a county-by-county table of all HLTHOUT exceedances, or (b) the same “mean+5” analysis using **population-weighted** averages instead of simple means.
