## 4) Total docket entries per year (2016–2025) and most active year
Using the provided docket list (231 total entries) and counting entries by their **date year**:

- **2016:** 33  
- **2017:** 13  
- **2018:** 14  
- **2019:** 22  
- **2020:** 18  
- **2021:** 23  
- **2022:** 30  
- **2023:** 18  
- **2024:** 9  
- **2025:** 3  

**Most active year:** **2016** (33 entries)  
**Second highest:** **2022** (30 entries)

## 5) Appeal-related docket entries and percentage of total
Counted docket entries that explicitly reference:
- **“Court of Appeals”** (including “Order of Court of Appeals,” “Acknowledgment from Court of Appeals,” “Transmittal … to court of appeals,” “Court of Appeals decision & order reversing,” etc.), and/or
- **“Supreme Court”** (acknowledgments/orders/decision/remittitur).

**Appeal-related entries identified:** **31**

- Court of Appeals-related (including remand orders, acknowledgments, transmittals, extensions, decision): **27**
- Supreme Court-related (acknowledgment/order/decision/remittitur): **4**

**Percentage of total docket entries:**
- Total docket entries = **231**
- Appeal-related = **31**
- **31 / 231 ≈ 13.4%**

**Answer:** **31 appeal-related entries**, about **13.4%** of the docket.

## 6) Receivables calculations (due, paid, balance, % collected)
Receivables record (single line) shows:
- **amountDue:** 761  
- **paid:** 352  
- **balanceDue:** 0  
- **adjust:** 0  
- **docCollected:** true  

Calculations:
- **Total amount due:** **$761**
- **Total paid:** **$352**
- **Remaining balance (computed as due − paid − adjust):** **$761 − $352 − $0 = $409**
- **Balance shown in record:** **$0** (WCCA field), but **probAmt = 409** strongly indicates **$409** was/should be handled via probation/collections mechanism even though the “balanceDue” field is 0.
- **% collected (paid / amountDue):** **352 / 761 ≈ 46.3%**

**Answer (financial reality from fields):**
- Due **$761**, Paid **$352**, Remaining **$409**, Collected **~46.3%**.  
*(Note: WCCA’s “balanceDue: 0” conflicts with due/paid math; the dataset also includes “probAmt: 409,” consistent with the $409 remainder.)*
