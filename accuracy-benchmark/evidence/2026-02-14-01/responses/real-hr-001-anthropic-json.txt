- **Quit rate:** 2.8x higher than government (2.21% vs 0.80%)  
- **Layoff rate:** 3.7x higher than government (1.23% vs 0.33%)

**Economic Interpretation:**
- The **private sector exhibits much more labor market dynamism** with higher hiring, quitting, and separation rates
- **Government employment is more stable** with lower turnover in both directions
- Government's low quit rate (0.80%) reflects better job security and retention
- Government's very low layoff rate (0.33%) reflects civil service protections
- However, government's high JO/HI ratio (2.40) combined with low hire rate suggests significant recruitment challenges despite job stability
