Other: 8 properties
```

### Breakdown by Zone Type

**Commercial (C) Zones: 23 properties (77%)**
- Dominated by high-density commercial districts (C6, C5)
- C6 zones permit FAR up to 15-18 (ultra-high density)
- C5 zones permit FAR up to 12-15 (high density)
- These zones allow mixed commercial/residential, offices, retail, hotels

**Manufacturing (M) Zones: 2 properties (7%)**
1. **360 West Street** (M2-3) - Javits Convention Center - $931M assessed value
2. **111 8th Avenue** (M1-5) - Google Building - $531M assessed value

**Residential (R) Zones: 2 properties (7%)**
1. **240 1 Avenue** (R7-2) - Mixed-use residential - $792M
2. **180 Ft Washington Ave** (R8) - Presbyterian Hospital - $460M

**Special Districts:**
- **PARK zone**: American Museum of Natural History ($474M)

### Key Finding
The overwhelming dominance of C6 and C5 zoning reflects these are Manhattan's premier commercial districts where the highest-intensity development is permitted. The presence of valuable properties in M zones shows industrial conversions to tech/commercial uses.

- 427 10th Avenue (2019) - $699M
- **Average: $627M**

### Key Findings on Age vs Value

**The #1 Property is the NEWEST:** 185 Greenwich Street (2009) - $1.67 BILLION
- This is the World Trade Center complex, explaining the exceptional value

**Surprisingly Strong 1940s Performance:** The single 1940s building has the highest average, but this is just one property (240 1st Avenue).

**2000s Decade Has Highest Average:** $941M average, driven by major trophy developments post-9/11 (WTC, Time Warner Center, 1 Bryant Park)

**1930s Art Deco Era Holds Value:** Iconic buildings like Empire State and Rockefeller Center maintain $500M+ valuations despite being 90+ years old

**No Clear Linear Relationship:** Newer ≠ automatically higher value. Location, size, and prestige matter more than age.

4. **Museum Natural History** - 194,323 SF (museum)
5. **Presbyterian Hospital** - 167,888 SF (healthcare)

### Typical Office Tower Floor Plates

**Median for O4 (Office) Class: ~40,000 SF**
- Range: 27,575 SF (Empire State, old slender tower) to 86,216 SF (185 Greenwich, modern efficient design)

### Pattern Analysis by Building Class

**O4 (Office buildings, Class B):** 
- Highly variable: 27,575 - 86,216 SF
- Newer buildings (2000s+) have LARGER floor plates (60,000-86,000 SF)
- Pre-war (1930s) have SMALLER floor plates (27,000-30,000 SF)

**RC (Residential/Commercial Condos):**
- More consistent: 30,316 - 47,424 SF
- Moderate floor plates for mixed-use efficiency

**RM (Mixed Residential):**
- Smallest: 20,429 - 38,926 SF
- Smaller plates allow better residential unit layouts

### Key Finding
**Modern office buildings maximize floor plate efficiency** (60,000-100,000 SF) for open-plan layouts and fewer core penetrations. **Pre-war towers have smaller plates** (27,000-40,000 SF) due to older structural systems and daylighting requirements before AC. **Special purpose buildings** (convention centers, hospitals) have massive floor plates optimized for their functions.

   - **3 confirmed properties**

2. **"UNAVAILABLE OWNER": $1,612,785,418**
   - 500 West 33rd - $744M
   - 1251 Avenue Americas - $511M
   - 601 Lexington - $452M
   - 666 5th Avenue - $450M
   - **4 properties** (data anonymization, likely major institutional owners)

3. **LOWER MANHATTAN DEVELOPMENT CORP: $1,673,531,100**
   - 185 Greenwich Street (WTC) - $1,674M

   - Empire State Building - $534M
   - **1 property**

### Other Notable Multi-Property Owners

**Time Warner Center/One Vanderbilt Area:**
- Multiple properties but different ownership structures

### Ownership Concentration Statistics

**Total Value in Dataset:** $18.26 billion

**Top 5 Owners Control:** $7.32 billion = **40% of total value**

**Public/Quasi-Public Ownership:** 
- LMDC, Javits, Museum, Hospital = $3.54 billion = **19.4% of total**

**Single-Property Owners:** 17 different owners = **57% of properties**

### Key Findings

**Moderate Concentration:** Top 5 owners control 40%, but this includes public entities and data anonymization ("Unavailable Owner")

**Rockefeller Group Dominates Private Ownership:** With 3+ properties worth $1.6B, represents the most significant private landlord concentration

**High Public Presence:** Nearly 20% of value in public/quasi-public hands (WTC, Javits, Museum, Hospital)

**Institutional Grade:** Most properties held by LLCs/institutional structures, not individuals. Names like "767 Fifth Partners," "509 W 34 LLC" indicate sophisticated ownership vehicles.

**Data Quality Issue:** "UNAVAILABLE OWNER" for $1.6B suggests PLUTO data privacy limitations for certain high-value properties

## 6. Lot Coverage Analysis

### Lot Coverage Calculation
**Formula:** (Building Footprint ÷ Lot Area) × 100
**Footprint Approximation:** bldgfront × bldgdepth (when available)

| Property | Lot Area | Footprint* | Coverage % | Assessment |

*Footprint = bldgfront × bldgdepth (when both >0)
⚠️ Coverage >100% indicates cantilevers, overhangs, or data measurement discrepancies

### Highest Lot Coverage (>100% - physically extends beyond lot)

1. **Time Warner Center** - 138.5% (complex geometry with cantilevers)
2. **1251 Avenue Americas** - 108.1% 
3. **240 1st Avenue** - 103.0% (mega-block development)
4. **666 5th Avenue** - 102.0%
5. **1290 Avenue Americas** - 100.3%

**These indicate towers with:**
- Cantilevers/setbacks above street level
- Underground extensions
- Air rights from adjacent lots
- Measurement methodology differences

### Lowest Lot Coverage (<30% - significant open space)

1. **185 Greenwich Street (WTC)** - 4.7% (massive 19-acre superblock with plaza)
2. **Museum Natural History** - 16.3% (campus with gardens)
3. **1260 Avenue Americas** - 26.1%
4. **388 Greenwich Street** - 27.9%

### Typical Commercial Tower Coverage: 80-100%

Most profitable commercial developments **maximize lot coverage** at street level, then set back at upper floors per zoning.

### Key Findings

**High-Value ≠ High Coverage:** The #1 property (185 Greenwich) has the LOWEST coverage (4.7%) because it's on a superblock with extensive public plazas required by zoning

**Pre-War vs Modern:** Pre-war towers (1930s-40s) tend toward 90-95% coverage. Modern towers (2000s+) show more variation (5-100%) based on site-specific zoning and design

**Midtown Pattern:** Avenue of Americas properties show remarkably consistent 90-108% coverage, indicating full lot-line development typical of that corridor

**Institutional Uses:** Museums and hospitals have lowest coverage (16-50%), preserving open space

## Summary of Key Insights

1. **Zoning**: C6 high-density commercial zones dominate (77%), enabling the FAR 15-18 supertowers that generate highest values

2. **Age**: 2000s buildings average highest ($941M) but iconic 1930s towers still command $500M+. Age is less important than location and prestige.

3. **Use**: 23 of 30 are office-dominant. True mixed-use is rare (3 properties). Pure office generates highest values.

4. **Floor Plates**: Modern efficiency = 60,000-100,000 SF plates. Pre-war towers had 27,000-40,000 SF. Bigger plates = higher values.

5. **Ownership**: Top 5 owners control 40% of value. Rockefeller entities dominate private ownership. Public entities hold 19%.

6. **Lot Coverage**: High value ≠ high coverage. WTC's 4.7% coverage (with plazas) is #1 property. Most commercial towers maximize at 90-100%.

7. **Geography**: Rockefeller Center corridor = 22% of total value in 3-block radius. Hudson Yards emerging as new value center. **West side now outvalues traditional East Side.**
