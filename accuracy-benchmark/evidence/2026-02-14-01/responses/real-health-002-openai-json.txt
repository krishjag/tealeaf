## 1) Percent of residents who are adults (18+)
Computed as: **adult_population / population × 100**

|---|---:|---:|---:|
| King | 2,271,380 | 1,836,529 | **80.86%** |
| Pierce | 928,696 | 716,813 | **77.18%** |

| Clark | 521,150 | 405,348 | **77.78%** |
| Yakima | 256,643 | 183,160 | **71.37%** |
| Whatcom | 231,919 | 189,784 | **81.83%** |

| Ferry | 7,497 | 6,217 | **82.93%** |
| Garfield | 2,363 | 1,865 | **78.92%** |

Highest % adults: **Island (83.03%)**. Lowest: **Yakima (71.37%)**.

## 2) Composite “chronic disease burden” score (average of 6 measures)
Measures averaged (crude prevalence, %): **ARTHRITIS, BPHIGH, DIABETES, CHD, COPD, STROKE**  
Score = mean of those six prevalences.

| County | Chronic disease burden score |
|---|---:|
| King | **10.52** |
| Pierce | **13.70** |
| Spokane | **13.82** |
| Clark | **13.52** |
| Yakima | **13.92** |
| Whatcom | **12.05** |
| Benton | **13.08** |
| Island | **15.68** |
| Ferry | **19.87** |
| Garfield | **16.38** |

## 3) Rank counties by chronic disease burden (highest → lowest)
1. **Ferry** — 19.87  
2. **Garfield** — 16.38  
3. **Island** — 15.68  
4. **Yakima** — 13.92  
5. **Spokane** — 13.82  
6. **Pierce** — 13.70  
7. **Clark** — 13.52  
8. **Benton** — 13.08  
9. **Whatcom** — 12.05  
10. **King** — 10.52

## 4) Disability burden: average DISABLT prevalence per county
Averaged across the 7 DISABLT measures: **COGNITION, DISABILITY, HEARING, INDEPLIVE, MOBILITY, SELFCARE, VISION**

| County | Avg disability prevalence (DISABLT mean) |
|---|---:|
| King | **7.77** |
| Pierce | **11.43** |
| Spokane | **11.19** |
| Clark | **10.56** |
| Yakima | **13.84** |
| Whatcom | **11.01** |
| Benton | **11.13** |
| Island | **10.76** |
| Ferry | **15.40** |
| Garfield | **11.71** |

**Highest disability burden:** **Ferry (15.40%)**.

---

## 5) Preventive service utilization leaders (PREVENT)
From the provided PREVENT measures:

- **Highest dental visit rate (DENTAL):** **King — 71.8%**
- **Highest mammography rate (MAMMOUSE):** **Spokane — 76.9%**
- **Highest cholesterol screening rate (CHOLSCREEN):** **Garfield — 86.4%**

---

## 6) Population-weighted average obesity (OBESITY) across all counties (weighted by adult_population)
Weighted mean = \(\sum (adult\_pop_i \times obesity_i) / \sum adult\_pop_i\)

- Total adult population (10 counties): **4,004,711**
- **Population-weighted obesity prevalence:** **29.07%**

(Heavily influenced by King County due to its large adult population and lower obesity prevalence.)

---

## 7) For each category, measure with the highest overall average prevalence (across counties)
Computed as the simple average of the measure’s prevalence across the 10 counties (not population-weighted).

### HLTHOUT (Health Outcomes)
- **HIGHCHOL (High cholesterol among screened): ~35.84%** (highest average in HLTHOUT)

### HLTHSTAT (Health Status)
- **MHLTH (Frequent mental distress): ~16.60%** (highest average in HLTHSTAT)

### PREVENT (Prevention)
- **CHOLSCREEN (Cholesterol screening): ~83.77%** (highest average in PREVENT)

### RISKBEH (Health Risk Behaviors)
- **SLEEP (Short sleep duration): ~31.51%** (highest average in RISKBEH)

### DISABLT (Disability)
- **DISABILITY (Any disability): ~29.90%** (highest average in DISABLT)

### HRSN (Health-Related Social Needs)
- **Not computable from the provided extract** (no HRSN measures were included in the county data shown).

If you want, I can also provide (a) uncertainty-aware comparisons using the confidence intervals, and/or (b) population-weighted category averages (which can change the “highest average measure” results, especially with King’s large population).
