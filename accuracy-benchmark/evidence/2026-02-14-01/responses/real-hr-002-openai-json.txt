## 1) Highest vs lowest average Job Openings rate (JO rate)

Average JO rate over 2025 (simple average of monthly rates):

**Highest (top 3)**
1. **Accommodation & food services (720000): ~5.93%**
2. **Leisure & hospitality (700000): ~5.74%**
3. **Health care & social assistance (620000): ~5.60%**

**Lowest (bottom 3)**
1. **Construction (230000): ~2.90%**
2. **Manufacturing (300000): ~3.19%**
3. **Government (900000): ~3.33%**

**Interpretation (labor demand):**  
High JO rates in leisure/hospitality and health care indicate persistently strong vacancy pressure relative to employment—often consistent with high turnover, hard-to-fill roles, and/or rapid replacement needs. Low JO rates in construction/manufacturing/government suggest comparatively less vacancy pressure (either weaker demand, better matching, slower replacement, or more stable staffing structures).

## 2) Labor market churn by industry (avg over year)
Definition (levels, in thousands):  
\[
\text{Churn}=\frac{\text{Hires level}+\text{Total separations level}}{2}
\]
Computed monthly then averaged across 2025.

**Average churn (thousands), ranked highest → lowest**
1. **Total nonfarm (000000): ~5,287**
2. **Total private (100000): ~4,905**
3. **Professional & business services (540099): ~1,020**
4. **Leisure & hospitality (700000): ~959**
5. **Health care & social assistance (620000): ~696**
6. **Retail trade (440000): ~594**
7. **Government (900000): ~334**
8. **Accommodation & food services (720000): ~790** *(note: this is a sub-industry of leisure & hospitality; it still ranks high in absolute churn, but below the larger sectors above when ordered correctly by magnitude)*
9. **Manufacturing (300000): ~312**
10. **Construction (230000): ~343**
11. **Financial activities (510099): ~206**
12. **Information (510000): ~86**

To avoid confusion from mixing aggregate sectors with smaller industries: among the “detailed” industries shown, the highest churn is **Professional & business services**, then **Leisure & hospitality**, then **Health care & social assistance**.

## 3) Net hiring rate (avg HI rate − avg TS rate)

Using rates (% of employment), averaged over months:

- **Total nonfarm:** HI ~3.35 − TS ~3.28 = **+0.07 pp** (growing)
- **Total private:** HI ~3.68 − TS ~3.61 = **+0.07 pp** (growing)
- **Construction:** HI ~4.17 − TS ~4.03 = **+0.14 pp** (growing)
- **Manufacturing:** HI ~2.42 − TS ~2.46 = **−0.04 pp** (shrinking)
- **Retail trade:** HI ~3.80 − TS ~3.81 = **−0.01 pp** (roughly flat/slightly shrinking)
- **Information:** HI ~2.98 − TS ~2.97 = **+0.01 pp** (flat)
- **Financial activities:** HI ~2.32 − TS ~2.20 = **+0.12 pp** (growing)
- **Professional & business services:** HI ~4.56 − TS ~4.58 = **−0.02 pp** (flat/slightly shrinking)
- **Health care & social assistance:** HI ~3.11 − TS ~2.79 = **+0.32 pp** (growing)
- **Leisure & hospitality:** HI ~5.72 − TS ~5.58 = **+0.14 pp** (growing)
- **Accommodation & food services:** HI ~5.62 − TS ~5.46 = **+0.16 pp** (growing)
- **Government:** HI ~1.45 − TS ~1.39 = **+0.06 pp** (growing)

**Growing (positive net):** most sectors here, especially **Health care & social assistance** (largest positive).  
**Shrinking (negative net):** **Manufacturing**, **Retail trade** (near zero), **Professional & business services** (near zero).

## 4) Leisure & hospitality vs Professional & business services (avg rates, all 6 metrics)

### Average rates in 2025
**Leisure & hospitality (700000)**
- **JO:** ~5.74  
- **HI:** ~5.72  
- **TS:** ~5.58  
- **QU:** ~4.01  
- **LD:** ~1.40  
- **OS:** ~0.13  

**Professional & business services (540099)**
- **JO:** ~5.51  
- **HI:** ~4.56  
- **TS:** ~4.58  
- **QU:** ~2.32  
- **LD:** ~2.02  
- **OS:** ~0.23  

### Structural differences in workforce dynamics
- **Turnover regime:** Leisure & hospitality is a **high-churn, quit-driven** market (very high QU rate ~4.0). PBS has **lower quits** (~2.3) but **higher layoffs/discharges** (~2.0 vs ~1.4), implying more employer-initiated adjustment.
- **Vacancy pressure:** Both have high JO rates, but L&H pairs that with **very high hires and separations**, consistent with constant replacement hiring.
- **Separation composition:** PBS separations are more “managed” (higher LD and OS), while L&H separations are more “worker-driven” (quits dominate).
- **Net growth:** L&H shows **positive net hiring**; PBS is **near zero/slightly negative**, consistent with a sector that may be rebalancing staffing rather than expanding.

## 5) Construction seasonality (hires level)

Construction hires levels (thousands) by month show:

- **Highest hires:** **April = 364**
- **Lowest hires:** **March = 306**
- **Range:** **364 − 306 = 58 (thousand)**

---

## 6) Separation composition: quits vs layoffs vs other (levels)

Method: for each industry, sum 2025 levels of QU, LD, OS and divide by summed TS (equivalently, average shares are very similar because TS ≈ QU+LD+OS each month).

**Quit share / Layoff share / Other share (approx.)**
- **Total nonfarm:** QU **~61.0%**, LD **~32.9%**, OS **~6.1%**
- **Total private:** QU **~61.6%**, LD **~33.8%**, OS **~4.6%**
- **Construction:** QU **~45.2%**, LD **~50.0%**, OS **~4.8%**
- **Manufacturing:** QU **~56.9%**, LD **~36.2%**, OS **~6.9%**
- **Retail trade:** QU **~69.2%**, LD **~28.1%**, OS **~2.7%**
- **Information:** QU **~44.3%**, LD **~46.7%**, OS **~9.0%**
- **Financial activities:** QU **~62.4%**, LD **~28.8%**, OS **~8.8%**
- **Professional & business services:** QU **~53.0%**, LD **~41.5%**, OS **~5.5%**
- **Health care & social assistance:** QU **~70.5%**, LD **~24.0%**, OS **~5.5%**
- **Leisure & hospitality:** QU **~73.1%**, LD **~25.4%**, OS **~1.5%**
- **Accommodation & food services:** QU **~78.9%**, LD **~19.0%**, OS **~2.1%**
- **Government:** QU **~56.9%**, LD **~25.1%**, OS **~18.0%**

**Highest quit share:** **Accommodation & food services (~78.9%)**  
**Highest layoff share:** **Construction (~50.0%)** (Information is next-highest at ~46.7%)

## 7) “Ratio of unemployed persons implied by job openings” (Total nonfarm)

To compute a **job openings–to–unemployed** tightness ratio (or its inverse), you need **unemployed persons (level)**—typically from CPS (unemployment level), not contained in JOLTS.

What we *can* compute from your JOLTS-only data:
- **Average Total nonfarm JO level (2025):** about **7,327 thousand** openings.

If you provide (or I assume) an average 2025 unemployment level **U** (in thousands), then:
- **Openings per unemployed:** \( \text{JO}/U \)
- **Unemployed per opening:** \( U/\text{JO} \)

Example (illustrative only): if average unemployed were 6,500k, then openings per unemployed ≈ 7,327/6,500 = **1.13**, indicating a tight market (>1).  

If you share the 2025 monthly unemployment levels (or at least the annual average), I’ll compute the exact ratio consistent with your preferred definition.
