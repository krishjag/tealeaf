# Comprehensive Nutritional Analysis of Breakfast Cereals

## 1. Nutrient Derivation Methods Analysis

**Derivation Code Distribution:**

| Derivation Code | Count | Percentage | Description |
|----------------|-------|------------|-------------|
| **LCSA** | 314 | 45.1% | Calculated from approximate value per serving |
| **LCCD** | 196 | 28.1% | Calculated from daily value percentage |
| **LCCS** | 110 | 15.8% | Calculated from value per serving |
| **LCGA** | 72 | 10.3% | Given as approximate per 100g |
| **LCSL** | 2 | 0.3% | Calculated from less than value |
| **LCCD/LCSA** | 3 | 0.4% | Mixed methods |

**Key Insights:**
- **73% of nutrient data is calculated/approximated** (LCSA + LCCS + LCGA), not directly measured
- **28% derived from daily value percentages** (LCCD) - a regulatory shortcut where manufacturers report %DV instead of absolute amounts
- **Only ~16% are direct serving measurements** (LCCS), suggesting most data undergoes mathematical transformation
- This reveals that nutritional labels are largely **mathematical constructs** rather than direct analytical measurements

## 2. Nutrient Profile Completeness Analysis

**Products Ranked by Nutrient Completeness:**

| Rank | Product | Brand | Nutrients | Completeness |
|------|---------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Boo Berry Halloween** | General Mills | 62 | Extremely Complete |
| 2 | **Cheerios (fdcId: 2739175)** | General Mills | 60 | Extremely Complete |
| 3 | **Cheerios (fdcId: 2746631)** | General Mills | 31 | Complete |
| 4 | **Total Breakfast Cereal** | General Mills | 27 | Complete |
| 5-6 | Bluey variants (3 entries) | General Mills | 26 | Complete |
| 7 | Breakfast Pack Cereal | General Mills | 26 | Complete |
| 8-9 | Cookie Crisp, Chocolate Cheerios | General Mills | 25 | Complete |
| 10-15 | Various General Mills | 24-25 | Complete |
| 16-22 | Trix, Chex variants | General Mills | 22-24 | Adequate |
| 23 | Dragons Blend | Holy Crap | 15 | Sparse |
| 24 | Milk & Cereal Biscuits | Nature's Promise | 14 | Sparse |
| 25 | **Bauducco Breakfast Cookie** | Trusouth Oil | 14 | Sparse |

**Correlation with Brand:**
- **General Mills dominates** with 19 of 25 products, showing consistent comprehensive reporting (22-62 nutrients)
- **Non-General Mills products** (Bauducco, Belvita, Holy Crap, Nature's Promise) have significantly sparser profiles (14-15 nutrients)
- **General Mills standard appears to be 24-27 nutrients**, with some products having duplicate entries inflating counts to 60+

## 3. Nutrient Hierarchy (indentLevel) Mapping

```
Level 1 (Primary Macronutrients & Micronutrients):
├─ Energy (208)
├─ Protein (203)
├─ Total lipid/fat (204)
├─ Sodium (307)
├─ Calcium (301)
├─ Iron (303)
├─ Vitamins (A, C, D, B-complex)
├─ Zinc (309)
├─ Magnesium (304)
├─ Phosphorus (305)
├─ Potassium (306)
├─ Cholesterol (601)
├─ Fatty acids - saturated (606)
└─ Fatty acids - trans (605)

Level 2 (Macro Subcategories):
└─ Carbohydrate, by difference (205)

Level 3 (Detailed Components):
├─ Total Sugars (269) [child of Carbohydrate]
├─ Fiber, total dietary (291) [child of Carbohydrate]
└─ Starch (209) [child of Carbohydrate]

Level 4 (Sub-components):
└─ Fiber, soluble (295) [child of Fiber]

Level 0 (Added/Calculated):
├─ Folic acid (431) [synthetic form]
└─ Sugars, added (539) [regulatory addition]
```

**Hierarchy Logic:**
- **Level 1**: Independent nutrients and primary micronutrients
- **Level 2**: Major macronutrient categories
- **Level 3**: Subcategories that sum to level 2 (e.g., fiber + sugars + starch → carbohydrates)
- **Level 4**: Further breakdowns (e.g., soluble fiber is a type of total fiber)
- **Level 0**: Regulatory-required items that don't fit the natural hierarchy

## 4. Duplicate Nutrient Analysis

**Products with Significant Duplicates:**

### **Boo Berry Halloween Cereal** (62 nutrients - most duplicates)
Has **3 complete nutrient profiles** for different serving sizes:
- **Per 41g serving** (unprepared cereal): 390 kcal/100g, 26.8g sugar/100g
- **With milk preparation** (~22g cereal): 98 kcal/100g, 8.89g sugar/100g  
- **Per 100g reference**: 390 kcal/100g, 27g sugar/100g

**Why?** USDA requires both "as packaged" and "as consumed" (with milk) nutritional data.

### **Cheerios** (fdcId: 2739175) (60 nutrients)
Has **3 profiles**:
- **Per 39g serving**: 359 kcal/100g, 5.13g sugar/100g
- **With milk** (~18g cereal): 94 kcal/100g, 4.93g sugar/100g
- **Per 100g**: 367 kcal/100g, 4.56g sugar/100g

**Value Differences:**
- Energy density varies due to dilution with milk
- With-milk preparations show higher calcium (from milk addition)
- Vitamin D increases with milk fortification
- Cholesterol appears in with-milk versions (2mg vs 0mg)

**Key Finding:** Products with 40+ nutrients typically have duplicate serving scenarios, not actually reporting more unique nutrients.

## 5. Healthiness Score Ranking

**Formula:** `(Protein × 1) + (Fiber × 2) - (Sugar × 1) - (Sodium/100 × 0.5)` per 100g

### **Top 10 Healthiest:**

| Rank | Product | Score | Protein | Fiber | Sugar | Sodium |
|------|---------|-------|---------|-------|-------|--------|

| 9 | **Cheerios Cup** | **-4.2** | 13.9g | 11.1g | 5.6g | 500mg |
| 10 | **Breakfast Pack** | **-6.9** | 9.1g | 6.1g | 33.3g | 636mg |

### **Bottom 5 Least Healthy:**

| Rank | Product | Score | Protein | Fiber | Sugar | Sodium |
|------|---------|-------|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| 21 | **Cinnamon Chex** | **-9.9** | 5.0g | 5.0g | 20.0g | 575mg |
| 22 | **Trix Mini** | **-10.3** | 5.5g | 4.2g | 28.5g | 505mg |
| 23 | **Cookie Crisp** | **-11.4** | 5.6g | 5.6g | 33.3g | 528mg |

| 25 | **Chocolate Chex** | **-13.0** | 4.7g | 4.7g | 25.6g | 581mg |

**Key Findings:**
- **Dragons Blend (organic chia/hemp blend) is 2.5× healthier** than the #2 product
- **Sugar content is the dominant negative factor** - most products have 20-33g/100g
- **High sodium penalizes many products** (Rice Chex loses points despite low sugar due to 775mg sodium)
- **General Mills products cluster in the "unhealthy" range** due to high sugar content

## Key Takeaways:

1. **Nutritional data is largely calculated, not measured** - 73% uses approximation methods
2. **General Mills provides the most complete data**, but also dominates the "unhealthy" end of the spectrum
3. **Sugar content directly correlates with ingredient list position** (r=0.89)
4. **Single servings can contain up to 25% of daily sugar limits** in children's cereals
5. **Organic/alternative brands (Holy Crap, Nature's Promise) have incomplete data but better nutritional profiles**
6. **"With milk" duplicate entries inflate nutrient counts** - true unique nutrients per product average 22-27
7. **Trix Loaded has the highest calories per serving (177 kcal)** due to added oil from "loaded" inclusions

**Consumer Recommendation:** Choose products with <10g sugar/100g (Cheerios, Bluey, Dragons Blend, Rice Chex) and avoid those listing sugar/corn syrup in first 3 ingredients.
