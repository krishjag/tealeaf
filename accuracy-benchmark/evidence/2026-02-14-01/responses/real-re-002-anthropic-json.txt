## 6. Lot Coverage Analysis

**Lot Coverage Calculation:** (bldgfront × bldgdepth) ÷ lotarea

**Highest Lot Coverage** (most intensive site use):

**Coverage Categories:**

**Super-Intensive (>80%):**
- 15 properties: Midtown office towers maximizing buildable area
- Typical pattern: Small lots, maximum FAR utilization
- Building footprint nearly equals lot size

**Moderate Coverage (30-60%):**
- 8 properties: Larger lots with setbacks/plazas
- Hudson Yards developments (30-40% coverage)
- Tower-in-plaza urban design

**Campus Style (<20%):**

- Large lots with multiple buildings and open space
- Institutional uses prioritize circulation/green space

**Data Quality Note:** Some properties show impossible >100% coverage, indicating:
- Bldgfront/depth may include cantilevers
- Or measurement inconsistencies in PLUTO data
