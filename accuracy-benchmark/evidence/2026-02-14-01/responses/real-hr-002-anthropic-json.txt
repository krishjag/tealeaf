# JOLTS 2025 Labor Market Analysis

## 1. Industries by Average Job Openings Rate

### **Highest 3:**
1. **Accommodation and food services: 5.83%**
2. **Leisure and hospitality: 5.73%**
3. **Health care and social assistance: 5.68%**

### **Lowest 3:**
1. **Construction: 2.90%**
2. **Manufacturing: 3.19%**
3. **Government: 3.33%**

**Interpretation:** The highest rates in hospitality and healthcare suggest persistent structural labor shortages in service-intensive sectors with high turnover and demanding working conditions. The lowest rates in construction and manufacturing reflect more stable workforces, but also potentially weaker labor demand in goods-producing sectors. Government's low rate indicates limited expansion capacity due to budget constraints.

## 4. Leisure & Hospitality vs. Professional & Business Services

### **Comparative Metrics (2025 Averages):**

| Metric | Leisure & Hospitality | Professional & Business Services | Difference |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| **JO rate** | 5.73% | 5.39% | +0.34 pp |
| **HI rate** | 5.72% | 4.54% | +1.18 pp |
| **TS rate** | 5.53% | 4.57% | +0.96 pp |
| **QU rate** | 3.99% | 2.34% | +1.65 pp |
| **LD rate** | 1.43% | 1.99% | -0.56 pp |
| **OS rate** | 0.13% | 0.23% | -0.10 pp |

### **Structural Differences:**

**Leisure & Hospitality:**
- **High-velocity labor market:** Both hire and separation rates near 5.7%, indicating almost 6% of the workforce turns over monthly
- **Quit-driven separations:** 72% of separations are quits (3.99%/5.53%), suggesting worker-initiated departures dominate
- **Lower layoff intensity:** Only 1.43% layoff rate suggests businesses try to retain workers despite volatility
- **Fragile stability:** Net growth of +0.19% despite massive churn suggests precarious equilibrium

**Professional & Business Services:**
- **Moderate-velocity with instability:** 4.5% hire/separation rates with slight contraction (-0.03%)
- **Balanced separation mix:** 51% quits (2.34%/4.57%) vs. 44% layoffs suggests economic restructuring, not just worker preference
- **Higher layoff rate (1.99%):** Indicates employers actively managing headcount through business cycles
- **Skills-based dynamics:** Lower quit rate suggests higher job-specific human capital and switching costs

**Bottom Line:** Hospitality is characterized by voluntary, friction-heavy turnover driven by working conditions and wages. Professional services show involuntary turnover from strategic business decisions, reflecting white-collar job market stress in 2025.

## 5. Construction Seasonality

**Highest hires month:** **April (364,000)**
**Lowest hires month:** **March (306,000)**
**Range:** **58,000 (18.9% variation)**

**Analysis:** The April peak aligns with spring construction season onset. March's low is puzzling given typical seasonal patterns, but may reflect 2025-specific factors (weather, project delays, or data volatility). The relatively modest range (19%) suggests seasonal effects are present but less pronounced than historical norms, possibly due to increased year-round construction activity or labor constraints that prevent seasonal surges.

## 6. Separation Composition by Industry (2025 Annual Totals)

| Industry | Quits % | Layoffs % | Other % | Total Separations (000s) |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------|-------------------------|

| Total nonfarm | 61.0% | 33.5% | 5.7% | 62,698 |
| Total private | 60.8% | 33.7% | 5.5% | 59,574 |

| Government | 37.0% | 38.5% | 24.5% | 3,124 |

### **Key Findings:**
- **Highest quit share:** Health care and social assistance (71.0%) - reflects burnout, wage dissatisfaction, and abundant alternative opportunities
- **Highest layoff share:** Construction (52.0%) - dominated by involuntary separations due to project-based work and weather/seasonality
- **Highest other share:** Government (24.5%) and Financial activities (13.1%) - retirement/transfer programs more common in these sectors

## 7. Job Openings and Labor Market Tightness (Total Nonfarm)

### **Average Monthly Job Openings:** 7,210,000 (ranging from 6,542,000 in December to 7,762,000 in January)

**Note:** To calculate the job openings-to-unemployment ratio (a key measure of labor market tightness), we would need unemployment data, which is not included in the JOLTS dataset. 

**Context for interpretation:**
- **Pre-pandemic typical ratio:** ~0.7 openings per unemployed person
- **2022 peak tightness:** ~2.0 openings per unemployed person
- **Fed "neutral" target:** ~1.0-1.2 openings per unemployed person

**What the JO trend suggests:**
The **decline from 7,762k (January) to 6,542k (December) — a 15.7% drop** — indicates **cooling labor demand** throughout 2025. The average opening rate of 4.4% is elevated historically, but the downward trajectory suggests the labor market is loosening from post-pandemic tightness. If unemployment remained stable around 6-7 million (4-4.5% unemployment rate with ~165M labor force), the implied ratio would be declining from ~1.3 to ~1.0, approaching more balanced conditions.
