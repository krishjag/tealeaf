8. **Island** (15.02)  
9. **Garfield** (16.47)  
10. **Ferry** (19.87)  

Highest chronic disease burden: **Ferry County**

## 4) Average disability prevalence (DISABLT) and highest disability burden
DISABLT measures averaged (7): **COGNITION, DISABILITY, HEARING, INDEPLIVE, MOBILITY, SELFCARE, VISION**

| County | Avg disability prevalence (%) |
|---|---:|
| King | 7.77 |
| Pierce | 11.43 |
| Spokane | 11.20 |

## 5) Preventive service utilization leaders (PREVENT)
Highest rates among the 10 counties:

- **Dental visit (DENTAL): King — 71.8%**
- **Mammography (MAMMOUSE): Spokane — 76.9%**
- **Cholesterol screening (CHOLSCREEN): Garfield — 86.4%**

(Next-highest for context: CHOLSCREEN Island 85.9%, King 85.6, Ferry 85.5)

---

## 6) Population-weighted average obesity (OBESITY) across all counties (weighted by adult_population)
Weighted mean formula: \(\sum (adult\_pop_i \times obesity_i) / \sum adult\_pop_i\)

- **Weighted average adult obesity prevalence = 29.0%** (approximately **29.04%**)

---

## 7) By category, measure with the highest overall *average prevalence* across counties
Averages are simple (unweighted) means across the 10 counties within each category.

### HLTHOUT (Health Outcomes)
- **HIGHCHOL (High Cholesterol)** — average **35.84%** (highest in HLTHOUT)

### HLTHSTAT (Health Status)
- **MHLTH (Frequent Mental Distress)** — average **16.80%** (highest in HLTHSTAT)

### PREVENT (Prevention)
- **CHOLSCREEN (Cholesterol Screening)** — average **83.77%** (highest in PREVENT)

### RISKBEH (Health Risk Behaviors)
- **SLEEP (Short Sleep Duration)** — average **31.51%** (highest in RISKBEH)

### DISABLT (Disability)
- **DISABILITY (Any Disability)** — average **29.90%** (highest in DISABLT)

If you want, I can also (a) compute uncertainty-aware comparisons using the confidence intervals (e.g., whether the “highest” is meaningfully higher), or (b) produce a single statewide “burden dashboard” combining chronic disease + disability + prevention gaps.
