**Key Insight:** Rural counties (Ferry, Garfield) have **nearly double** the chronic disease burden of urban King County, representing a significant health disparity.

## 4. Disability Burden Analysis

**Average of 7 disability measures** (COGNITION, DISABILITY, HEARING, INDEPLIVE, MOBILITY, SELFCARE, VISION)

| Rank | County | Avg Disability % | Standout Measures |
|------|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Ferry** | **15.40%** | Any disability: 38.7%, Mobility: 19.4% |
| 2 | **Yakima** | 13.84% | Mobility: 15.4%, Cognition: 17.7% |
| 3 | **Garfield** | 11.71% | Any disability: 30.4% |
| 4 | **Pierce** | 11.43% | Any disability: 30.9% |
| 5 | **Spokane** | 11.20% | Consistent across types |
| 6 | **Benton** | 11.13% | Similar to Spokane |
| 7 | **Whatcom** | 11.01% | Slightly below average |
| 8 | **Island** | 10.76% | Moderate burden |
| 9 | **Clark** | 10.56% | Below state average |
| 10 | **King** | **7.77%** | Lowest disability burden |

**Critical Finding:** Ferry County has the **highest disability burden (15.40%)**, nearly **double** that of King County (7.77%). This correlates strongly with its chronic disease burden.

## 5. Preventive Service Utilization - Top Performers

### Dental Visits (Past Year)
**Winner: King County (71.8%)**
- Island: 70.5%
- Clark: 69.1%
- **Lowest:** Yakima (55.0%)
- **Gap:** 16.8 percentage points

### Mammography (Women 50-74)
**Winner: Spokane County (76.9%)**
- King: 75.6%
- Clark & Garfield: 75.2% (tied)
- **Lowest:** Ferry (62.7%)
- **Gap:** 14.2 percentage points

### Cholesterol Screening
**Winner: Garfield County (86.4%)**
- Island: 85.9%
- Ferry: 85.5%
- King: 85.6%
- **Lowest:** Yakima (79.2%)
- **Gap:** 7.2 percentage points

**Notable:** Small rural counties (Garfield, Ferry) excel at cholesterol screening despite poor health outcomes, suggesting access issues may not be universal but rather condition-specific.

## 6. Population-Weighted Obesity Prevalence

### Calculation across all 10 counties (weighted by adult population):

**Population-Weighted Average: 29.50%**

#### County Comparison:
- **Below average:** King (22.6%), Whatcom (26.5%)
- **Above average:** Pierce (36.9%), Spokane (34.7%), Clark (35.3%), Yakima (39.7%), Benton (36.2%), Island (31.3%), Ferry (40.2%), Garfield (31.0%)

**Highest:** Ferry County (40.2%) - nearly **double** King County (22.6%)

**Urban-Rural Disparity:** King County's low obesity rate (22.6%) significantly pulls down the state average due to its large population (1.8M adults), masking higher rates in smaller counties.

## 7. Highest Average Prevalence Measures by Category

### **HLTHOUT (Health Outcomes):**
**HIGH CHOLESTEROL: 35.84% average**
- Affects more than 1 in 3 screened adults statewide
- Range: 33.1% (Whatcom) to 41.2% (Ferry)

### **HLTHSTAT (Health Status):**
**FAIR/POOR GENERAL HEALTH: 18.30% average**
- Nearly 1 in 5 adults rate their health as fair/poor
- Range: 12.5% (King) to 26.4% (Yakima)

### **PREVENT (Prevention):**
**CHOLESTEROL SCREENING: 83.77% average**
- Best preventive service uptake
- High compliance across all counties (79-86%)

### **RISKBEH (Risk Behaviors):**
**SHORT SLEEP DURATION: 31.51% average**
- Nearly 1 in 3 adults get insufficient sleep
- Range: 29.0% (King, Island) to 37.0% (Pierce)

### **DISABLT (Disability):**
**ANY DISABILITY: 29.90% average**
- 3 in 10 adults report some form of disability
- Range: 20.9% (King) to 38.7% (Ferry)

## Key Epidemiological Findings

### 1. **Severe Urban-Rural Health Disparities**
- Ferry and Garfield counties consistently show 1.5-2x worse health outcomes than King County
- Geographic isolation and socioeconomic factors likely contributors

### 2. **The "Prevention Paradox"**
- Rural counties with worst health outcomes (Ferry, Garfield) have highest screening rates
- Suggests access to preventive care exists, but upstream social determinants drive poor outcomes

### 3. **Yakima's Unique Profile**
- Highest diabetes (12.9%) and obesity (39.7%)
- Lowest dental visits (55.0%) and colorectal screening (55.9%)
- Highest uninsured rate (18.8%) - more than **2.5x** King County
- Points to health equity challenges in agricultural communities

### 4. **Mental Health Crisis Statewide**
- Depression averages 25.11% across counties
- Whatcom County highest at 29.5%
- Affects all county types - urban, suburban, rural

### 5. **Sleep Deprivation Epidemic**
- Short sleep affects 31.51% statewide
- Pierce County worst at 37%
- Links to chronic disease, mental health outcomes
