  - Cash balance of $35.9B, marketable securities of $96.5B ($132.4B liquid assets)
  - **Net debt position**: $98.7B debt - $132.4B liquid = **Net cash of $33.7B**
  - Interest coverage appears healthy despite lack of explicit metric
- **Verdict**: Not concerning given fortress balance sheet and FCF

### 🟡 **VISA - Litigation Escrow**
- **Issue**: $3.0B restricted cash for U.S. litigation escrow
- **Accrued litigation**: $3.0B in current liabilities
- **Severity**: LOW - Well-provisioned and disclosed
