## 1) Percent of residents who are adults (18+)
Calculated as: **adult_population / population × 100**

| County | Population | Adult pop | % adults |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| King | 2,271,380 | 1,836,529 | 80.9% |
| Pierce | 928,696 | 716,813 | 77.2% |
| Spokane | 551,455 | 433,863 | 78.7% |
| Clark | 521,150 | 405,348 | 77.8% |
| Yakima | 256,643 | 183,160 | 71.4% |
| Whatcom | 231,919 | 189,784 | 81.8% |
| Benton | 215,219 | 159,518 | 74.1% |
| Island | 86,267 | 71,614 | 83.0% |
| Ferry | 7,497 | 6,217 | 82.9% |
| Garfield | 2,363 | 1,865 | 78.9% |

Highest % adults: **Island (83.0%)** (very close: Ferry 82.9%). Lowest: **Yakima (71.4%)**.

## 2) Composite “chronic disease burden” score (mean of 6 measures)
Definition: average of **ARTHRITIS, BPHIGH, DIABETES, CHD, COPD, STROKE** (all crude %).

| County | Chronic disease burden score |
|---|---:|
| King | 10.6 |
| Pierce | 13.7 |
| Spokane | 13.8 |
| Clark | 13.7 |
| Yakima | 14.3 |
| Whatcom | 12.1 |
| Benton | 13.1 |
| Island | 15.1 |
| Ferry | 19.9 |
| Garfield | 16.5 |

(Example: King = (19.4+26.7+7.3+4.0+3.4+2.3)/6 = **10.6**)

---

## 3) Rank counties by chronic disease burden (highest → lowest)
1. **Ferry — 19.9**
2. **Garfield — 16.5**
3. **Island — 15.1**
4. **Yakima — 14.3**
5. **Spokane — 13.8**
6. **Pierce — 13.7**
7. **Clark — 13.7**
8. **Benton — 13.1**
9. **Whatcom — 12.1**
10. **King — 10.6**

## 4) Disability burden: average DISABLT prevalence per county
Computed as the mean of the 7 disability measures: **COGNITION, DISABILITY, HEARING, INDEPLIVE, MOBILITY, SELFCARE, VISION**.

| County | Avg disability prevalence (DISABLT mean) |
|---|---:|
| King | 7.8 |
| Pierce | 11.4 |
| Spokane | 11.2 |
| Clark | 10.6 |
| Yakima | 13.8 |
| Whatcom | 11.0 |
| Benton | 11.1 |
| Island | 10.8 |
| Ferry | 15.4 |
| Garfield | 11.7 |

**Highest disability burden: Ferry (15.4%)**.

---

## 5) Preventive service utilization leaders (PREVENT)
Highest rates among the 10 counties:

- **Dental visit (DENTAL): King — 71.8%**
- **Mammography (MAMMOUSE): Spokane — 76.9%**
- **Cholesterol screening (CHOLSCREEN): Garfield — 86.4%**

---

## 6) Population-weighted average obesity (OBESITY), weighted by adult_population
Weighted mean obesity prevalence across all 10 counties:

\[
\frac{\sum(\text{adult pop}_i \times \text{obesity}_i)}{\sum(\text{adult pop}_i)}
\]

- Total adult population (10 counties): **4,004,711**
- **Population-weighted obesity average: 28.0%**

(Heavily influenced by King due to its large adult population and lower obesity prevalence.)

---

## 7) By category, measure with the highest overall average prevalence (across counties)
Averaged each measure across the 10 counties within its category (using the values provided). Highest-average measure per category:

- **HLTHOUT (Health Outcomes): HIGHCHOL (High cholesterol) — avg 35.3%**
- **HLTHSTAT (Health Status): GHLTH (Fair/poor self-rated health) — avg 18.3%**
- **PREVENT (Prevention): CHOLSCREEN (Cholesterol screening) — avg 83.8%**
- **RISKBEH (Risk Behaviors): SLEEP (Short sleep duration) — avg 31.5%**
- **DISABLT (Disability): DISABILITY (Any disability) — avg 29.9%**
- **HRSN (Health-Related Social Needs):** not computable from the excerpt provided (no HRSN measures/values included for these counties)

If you want, I can also (a) add uncertainty-aware comparisons using the confidence intervals, or (b) compute z-score standardized composites so measures with different baselines don’t dominate the chronic disease score.
