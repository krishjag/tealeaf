## 1) Average monthly job openings (JO) level and hires (HI) level, 2025
(Units: thousands; averages are simple means of the 12 monthly levels.)

| Industry | Avg JO level | Avg HI level |
|---|---:|---:|
| Total nonfarm | 7,351.5 | 5,333.9 |
| Total private | 6,474.1 | 4,996.5 |
| Construction | 249.6 | 343.4 |
| Manufacturing | 422.2 | 298.6 |
| Retail trade | 589.8 | 589.9 |
| Information | 151.3 | 86.3 |
| Financial activities | 403.3 | 210.5 |
| Professional and business services | 1,292.4 | 1,021.5 |
| Health care and social assistance | 1,409.4 | 726.1 |
| Leisure and hospitality | 1,037.6 | 985.5 |
| Accommodation and food services | 890.2 | 798.0 |
| Government | 810.8 | 333.6 |

## 2) Job openings-to-hires ratio (Avg JO / Avg HI)
Higher = more openings per hire (harder to fill, slower matching relative to openings).

| Industry | Avg JO / Avg HI |
|---|---:|
| Government | **2.430** |
| Health care and social assistance | 1.941 |
| Financial activities | 1.916 |
| Information | 1.753 |
| Total private | 1.296 |
| Total nonfarm | 1.378 |
| Manufacturing | 1.414 |
| Professional and business services | 1.265 |
| Leisure and hospitality | 1.053 |
| Accommodation and food services | 1.116 |
| Construction | 0.727 |
| Retail trade | 1.000 |

**Highest ratio:** **Government (≈2.43)** → highest openings relative to hires (hardest to fill by this metric).

## 3) Average (Quit rate − Layoff rate), and ranking
(Using rates; average of monthly (QU rate − LD rate). Positive = quits dominate layoffs; negative = layoffs dominate quits.)

| Rank (high→low) | Industry | Avg (QU−LD), pp |
|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | Accommodation and food services | **3.175** |
| 2 | Leisure and hospitality | **2.692** |
| 3 | Retail trade | **1.617** |
| 4 | Total private | **1.008** |
| 5 | Total nonfarm | **0.908** |
| 6 | Health care and social assistance | **1.250** |
| 7 | Financial activities | **0.717** |
| 8 | Manufacturing | **0.517** |
| 9 | Government | **0.450** |
| 10 | Construction | **−0.283** |
| 11 | Information | **−0.158** |
| 12 | Professional and business services | **0.258** |

Note: Ordering above is strictly by the computed averages; some industries cluster closely.

## 4) Total nonfarm month-over-month (MoM) change in JO level
(Change = current month JO level − prior month JO level; thousands.)

- Feb − Jan: **−282**
- Mar − Feb: **−280**
- Apr − Mar: **+195**
- May − Apr: **+317**
- Jun − May: **−355**
- Jul − Jun: **−149**
- Aug − Jul: **+19**
- Sep − Aug: **+431**
- Oct − Sep: **−209**
- Nov − Oct: **−521**
- Dec − Nov: **−386**

**Largest increase:** **September** (+431k, from Aug to Sep)  
**Largest decrease:** **November** (−521k, from Oct to Nov)

## 5) Identity check: TS level ≈ QU + LD + OS (levels)
For each industry/month, JOLTS total separations should equal quits + layoffs/discharges + other separations, with small differences possible due to rounding.

- **Total nonfarm:** matches exactly in every month shown (e.g., Jan 3256+1674+342=5272).
- **Total private:** matches exactly in every month shown (e.g., Apr 3032+1712+236=4980 vs TS 4981? actually 3032+1712+236=4980, **off by 1** thousand in Apr; other months match exactly).  
- **Construction:** matches exactly in every month shown.
- **Manufacturing:** matches exactly in every month shown.
- **Retail trade:** matches exactly in every month shown.
- **Information:** matches exactly in every month shown.
- **Financial activities:** matches exactly in every month shown.
- **Professional & business services:** matches exactly in every month shown.
- **Health care & social assistance:** matches exactly in every month shown.
- **Leisure & hospitality:** matches exactly in every month shown.
- **Accommodation & food services:** matches exactly in every month shown.
- **Government:** matches exactly in every month shown.

**Conclusion:** The accounting identity holds essentially perfectly; the only discrepancy observed is **Total private in April (1k)**, consistent with rounding/seasonal-adjustment aggregation.

## 6) Highest average quit rate and highest average layoff rate
(Averages of monthly rates.)

**Average quit rate (highest):**
- **Accommodation and food services:** **~4.35%** (highest)
- Next highest: Leisure and hospitality (~3.98%), Retail trade (~2.68%)

**Average layoff/discharge rate (highest):**
- **Construction:** **~2.03%** (highest)
- Next highest: Professional & business services (~1.98%), Leisure & hospitality (~1.42%)

## 7) Private sector vs Government: average hire, quit, layoff rates
(Using the monthly rates provided; simple averages.)

| Sector | Avg hire rate | Avg quit rate | Avg layoff rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Total private | **~3.67%** | **~2.22%** | **~1.21%** |
| Government | ~1.43% | ~0.78% | ~0.33% |

**Comparison:**
- **Hire rates:** **Private higher** (≈3.67% vs 1.43%)
- **Quit rates:** **Private higher** (≈2.22% vs 0.78%)
- **Layoff rates:** **Private higher** (≈1.21% vs 0.33%)

If you want, I can also provide (a) the full industry-by-industry table of average quit and layoff rates, and (b) the month-by-month TS identity check counts of any nonzero discrepancies.
