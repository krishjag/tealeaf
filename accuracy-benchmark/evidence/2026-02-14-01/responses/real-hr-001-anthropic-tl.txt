## 3. Quit Rate Minus Layoff Rate (Voluntary vs. Involuntary Turnover Balance)

| Rank | Industry | QU - LD Rate | Interpretation |
|------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | Accommodation & food services | +3.29% | Heavily voluntary |
| 2 | Leisure and hospitality | +2.57% | Heavily voluntary |
| 3 | Retail trade | +1.58% | Heavily voluntary |

| 11 | Information | -0.10% | Slightly involuntary |
| 12 | Construction | -0.27% | Involuntary |

**Key Finding:** Service industries (accommodation/food, leisure/hospitality, retail) show the highest voluntary turnover, indicating workers leave by choice. Construction and Information show negative values, meaning layoffs exceed quits - these industries had more involuntary separations.

| Month | Job Openings (000s) | Change from Prior Month |
|-------|---------------------|------------------------|
| January | 7,762 | -- |

| October | 7,449 | -209 |
| **November** | **6,928** | **-521** ⬇️ **LARGEST DECREASE** |
| December | 6,542 | -386 |

**Key Finding:** September saw the largest jump in job openings (+431K), possibly due to fall hiring plans. November had the steepest decline (-521K), followed by December (-386K), suggesting cooling labor demand heading into year-end.

## 5. Verification of Total Separations Formula

**Formula: Total Separations = Quits + Layoffs & Discharges + Other Separations**

Sample verification (levels in thousands):

| Industry | Month | Quits | + Layoffs | + Other | = Sum | Reported TS | Match? |
|----------|-------|-------|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Total nonfarm | Jan | 3,256 | 1,674 | 342 | 5,272 | 5,272 | ✓ |
| Construction | Apr | 162 | 180 | 14 | 356 | 357 | ✓ (rounding) |
| Retail trade | Dec | 515 | 135 | 14 | 664 | 664 | ✓ |
| Manufacturing | May | 148 | 111 | 24 | 283 | 283 | ✓ |
| Government | Sep | 211 | 80 | 75 | 366 | 365 | ✓ (rounding) |

**Conclusion:** The reported total separations match the sum of components within rounding errors (typically ±1K due to independent seasonal adjustment).

2. **Quits:** Private sector quit rate is **2.8x higher** than government, indicating:
   - Greater job mobility in private sector
   - More stable employment and better retention in government
   - Stronger job security and benefits in public sector jobs

3. **Layoffs:** Private sector layoff rate is **3.7x higher** than government, reflecting:
