### 8. **Risk Flags & Concerns:**

✅ **ALL COMPANIES HEALTHY - No Major Concerns**

**Observations:**
- ✅ **No negative free cash flow** - All four companies generate strong positive FCF
- ✅ **No concerning debt levels** - All maintain investment-grade profiles
- ✅ **Strong interest coverage** - All can easily service debt obligations

**Minor Considerations:**

⚠️ **Apple** (Lowest concern):
- Highest leverage at 1.34 D/E, but still manageable
- Massive cash generation ($99B FCF) more than covers debt service
- $90.7B stock buybacks show confidence and strong capital position

⚠️ **Costco** (Informational only):
- Lowest FCF margin (2.8%) reflects low-margin retail business model
- Heavy capex for warehouse expansion ($5.5B)
- Business model prioritizes growth over margins - this is normal

**Credit Quality Assessment:**
- **Costco & Visa**: AAA/AA tier - Fortress balance sheets
- **Qualcomm**: AA/A tier - Strong financial position
- **Apple**: A tier - Elevated leverage offset by exceptional cash generation

All four companies demonstrate **excellent financial health** with strong cash generation, manageable debt levels, and robust interest coverage ratios.
