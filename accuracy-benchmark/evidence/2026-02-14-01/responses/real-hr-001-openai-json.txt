## 1) Average monthly job openings (JO) level and hires (HI) level, 2025 (thousands)

Averages are simple means of the 12 seasonally adjusted monthly **levels**.

| Industry | Avg JO level | Avg HI level |
|---|---:|---:|
| Total nonfarm | 7,351.5 | 5,333.9 |
| Total private | 6,499.1 | 4,996.3 |
| Construction | 249.6 | 343.4 |
| Manufacturing | 420.5 | 298.6 |
| Retail trade | 592.3 | 589.9 |
| Information | 151.3 | 85.1 |
| Financial activities | 403.3 | 210.5 |
| Professional & business services | 1,309.1 | 1,029.4 |
| Health care & social assistance | 1,409.0 | 726.0 |
| Leisure & hospitality | 1,037.6 | 977.2 |
| Accommodation & food services | 889.8 | 806.3 |
| Government | 810.8 | 336.1 |

## 2) Job openings-to-hires ratio (Avg JO / Avg HI). Highest = “hardest to fill”

| Industry | Avg JO/HI |
|---|---:|
| Financial activities | **1.92** |
| Information | 1.78 |
| Health care & social assistance | 1.94 |
| Total nonfarm | 1.38 |
| Total private | 1.30 |
| Professional & business services | 1.27 |
| Government | 2.41 |
| Manufacturing | 1.41 |
| Retail trade | 1.00 |
| Leisure & hospitality | 1.06 |
| Accommodation & food services | 1.10 |
| Construction | 0.73 |

**Highest ratio:** **Government (2.41)** — highest openings relative to hiring flow (hardest to fill by this metric).  
**Next highest:** Health care & social assistance (1.94) and Financial activities (1.92).

## 3) Average (Quit rate − Layoff rate), 2025, and ranking (higher = more voluntary vs involuntary)

Computed as the average over months of **(QU rate − LD rate)**.

| Rank | Industry | Avg (QU−LD) rate (pp) |
|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | Accommodation & food services | **+3.31** |
| 2 | Leisure & hospitality | **+2.55** |
| 3 | Retail trade | **+1.54** |
| 4 | Total private | **+1.02** |
| 5 | Total nonfarm | **+0.88** |
| 6 | Health care & social assistance | **+1.25** |
| 7 | Financial activities | **+0.73** |
| 8 | Manufacturing | **+0.48** |
| 9 | Government | **+0.43** |
| 10 | Construction | **+0.02** |
| 11 | Professional & business services | **+0.47** |
| 12 | Information | **−0.07** |

Notes:
- **Accommodation & food services** and **Leisure & hospitality** have the strongest “voluntary-heavy” turnover balance.
- **Information** is the only one with a slightly negative balance on average (layoffs about equal to or a bit above quits).

## 4) Total nonfarm month-over-month (MoM) change in JO level (thousands)

JO levels (Total nonfarm): Jan 7762, Feb 7480, Mar 7200, Apr 7395, May 7712, Jun 7357, Jul 7208, Aug 7227, Sep 7658, Oct 7449, Nov 6928, Dec 6542.

MoM changes:
- **Feb −282**
- **Mar −280**
- **Apr +195**
- **May +317**
- **Jun −355**
- **Jul −149**
- **Aug +19**
- **Sep +431**
- **Oct −209**
- **Nov −521**
- **Dec −386**

**Largest increase:** **September (+431k)** (Aug → Sep)  
**Largest decrease:** **November (−521k)** (Oct → Nov)

## 5) Verify TS level ≈ QU + LD + OS (levels), within rounding

For each industry/month, JOLTS reports **TS** and its components **QU, LD, OS**. Using the provided levels, the identity holds essentially exactly (differences are 0 in the data shown), e.g.:

- **Total nonfarm, January:** QU 3256 + LD 1674 + OS 342 = **5272**, matches TS **5272**.
- **Retail trade, February:** 404 + 229 + 12 = **645**, matches TS **645**.
- **Professional & business services, June:** 404 + 545 + 67 = **1016**, matches TS **1016**.

**Conclusion:** The component sum matches reported TS **within rounding (and in these data, exactly).**

## 6) Highest average quit rate and highest average layoff rate (rates)

Average quit rates (percent) and layoff rates (percent) are simple means of monthly rates.

- **Highest average quit rate:** **Accommodation & food services (~4.35%)**  
  (Leisure & hospitality is next at ~3.99%.)

- **Highest average layoff rate:** **Construction (~2.08%)**  
  (Professional & business services is next at ~2.00%.)

## 7) Private sector vs Government: average hire, quit, and layoff rates

Averages of monthly **rates**:

| Sector | Avg hire rate | Avg quit rate | Avg layoff rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Total private | **3.65%** | **2.22%** | **1.23%** |
| Government | 1.43% | 0.78% | 0.33% |

**Comparison:** **Total private is higher on all three**—hire rates, quit rates, and layoff rates—than **Government** on average in 2025.

If you want, I can also provide (a) the full table of average quit and layoff rates by industry, and/or (b) confidence-style cautions about interpreting JO/HI as “hard to fill” given industry differences in vacancy duration and recruiting intensity.
