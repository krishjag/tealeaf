## 1) Charge progression (original vs. final; additions/drops/modifications; enhancers)

### Original charges (Charge History / “Information Filed”)
Charge history shows **two counts** filed in the Information and carried forward as the core charging instruments:
1. **Count 1:** *Battery by Prisoners* — **Wis. Stat. § 940.20(1)** — **Class H felony**
2. **Count 2:** *Disorderly Conduct* — **Wis. Stat. § 947.01(1)** — **Class B misdemeanor**

No additional counts appear in charge history beyond these two.

### Final charges at conviction (after jury trial)
The final “charges” section shows the same two counts, but with **modifiers (enhancers)** applied:

**Count 1 (final):** Battery by Prisoners, § 940.20(1), Felony H  
Modifiers:
- **Repeater** — **§ 939.62(1)(b)**
- **Use of a Dangerous Weapon** — **§ 939.63(1)(b)**

**Count 2 (final):** Disorderly Conduct, § 947.01(1), Misd. B  
Modifiers:
- **Repeater** — **§ 939.62(1)(a)**
- (Dangerous weapon enhancer is not part of the final conviction on Ct. 2; see below.)

### Were charges added, dropped, or modified?
- **Counts added/dropped:** No. The case begins and ends with **two counts**.
- **Modifiers changed by outcome:** The jury verdict and sentencing record reflect that:
  - **Ct. 1**: guilty **with** dangerous weapon enhancer (and repeater).
  - **Ct. 2**: guilty **without** dangerous weapon enhancer; the judgment text explicitly notes: **“With use of a dangerous weapon enhancer dismissed.”**  
  So, **Ct. 2’s weapon enhancer was effectively dropped/dismissed**, while Ct. 1’s weapon enhancer remained.

## 3) Appellate trajectory (Court of Appeals + Supreme Court entries, chronological) and outcome

Below are the appellate-related docket events appearing in this circuit-court docket (they reflect appellate activity and remands). The appeal number referenced is **2022AP000959**.

### Court of Appeals (COA) – pre-appeal deadline management
- **2020-06-11** Motion to extend time for appointing postconviction counsel/ordering transcripts (filed by appellate atty Joseph Ehmann)

### Court of Appeals – appeal initiated and record activity

- **2022-09-30** COA order: **retains jurisdiction and remands** for **supplemental postconviction motion** (due 10/31/22) and circuit court decision within 90 days; briefing deadline tied to return of record

### Court of Appeals – remand completion / supplemental record

- **2023-06-01** COA order extending time to file appellant’s brief (after remand record return)
- **2024-04-25** **COA decision & order reversing**:  
  “**Reverse the Judgment of Conviction and Circuit Court Orders Denying Postconviction Motions and remand for the Circuit Court to Dismiss the Complaint**.”

### Supreme Court – petition for review and final decision
- **2024-05-28** Acknowledgment from Supreme Court (petition for review stage)
- **2024-10-07** Order of the Supreme Court (entry present; details not stated in docket text)
- **2024-11-11** Supreme Court order granting motion; State’s opening brief due **2024-12-06**

**Trajectory and outcome (as reflected here):**
- COA ultimately **reversed** the conviction and ordered remand with direction to **dismiss the complaint** (4/25/2024).
- The case then proceeded to **Wisconsin Supreme Court review**, culminating in a **Supreme Court decision filed 6/27/2025** and **remittitur 9/5/2025**.  
- The circuit docket does **not include the text/outcome** of the Supreme Court decision (affirm/reverse/modify of COA). It only shows that a decision was filed. (To determine the final statewide outcome, you’d need the Supreme Court opinion/disposition.)

## 4) Sentencing structure and supervision conditions (Ct. 1 vs Ct. 2)

### Count 1 sentence (Battery by Prisoners, repeater + dangerous weapon)
- **Initial confinement (State Prison):** **12 years**
  - **Consecutive to:** “Any other sentence currently serving.”
- **Extended supervision:** **3 years**
  - **Consecutive to:** “Any other sentence currently serving.”
- **Conditions noted under ES (structured conditions list):**
  - **Costs:** civil judgment language if outstanding obligations at discharge/revocation
  - **Other:** **Submit DNA sample**; **No contact with the victim of this case**

### Count 2 sentence (Disorderly Conduct, repeater; weapon enhancer dismissed)
- **Initial confinement (State Prison):** **1 year**
  - **Concurrent with:** Ct. 1
- **Extended supervision:** **6 months**
  - **Concurrent with:** Ct. 1
- **Conditions:**
  - **Costs:** “Same conditions as Ct. 1.”

### How conditions differ
- Ct. 1 explicitly lists **DNA submission** and **no-contact with victim** (and the costs/civil judgment language).
- Ct. 2 does **not** restate DNA/no-contact in its own condition list; instead it incorporates by reference: **“Same conditions as Ct. 1.”**  
  Practically, that suggests Ct. 2’s ES conditions mirror Ct. 1’s, but the record is more explicit on Ct. 1.

## 5) Habeas corpus activity (count and interpretation)

### How many writs/petitions appear?
Counting docket entries labeled **“Writ of Habeas Corpus”** and **“Petition for writ of habeas corpus”** (including multiple for different dates/institutions), the docket shows **approximately 16 habeas-related filings**:

**Early case / hearings (2016):**
- 2016-02-16 (petition) for 2/25/16
- 2016-02-16 (petition) for 2/18/16
- 2016-02-24 (petition) for 3/3/16
- 2016-03-14 (petition) for 5/10/16
- 2016-06-08 (petition) for 7/20/16
- 2016-07-22 (petition) (return date context)
- 2016-08-10 (petition) (Oct 2016 writ)
- 2016-08-17 (petition) (Oct 2016 writ)

**Trial/sentencing transport (2018–2020):**
- 2018-02-22 (petition) (trial-related)
- 2018-02-22 (petition) (second petition same day)
- 2019-12-02 (petition) (trial)
- 2019-12-17 (petition) (sentencing)
- 2020-02-17 (petition) (sentencing)

**Postconviction evidentiary hearings (2021):**
- 2021-08-16 (petition) for Green Bay CI (9/10/21)
- 2021-08-16 (petition) for WSPF (9/10/21)
- 2021-10-27 (petition) for Green Bay CI (11/29/21)

Additionally, there are multiple **issued writ orders** (“Writ of Habeas Corpus” entries) corresponding to these petitions (e.g., 2016-02-16/2016-02-24/2016-08-??/2018-02-23/2019-12-02/2019-12-18/2021-08-17/2021-11-02).

### What the pattern suggests
This pattern is consistent with a defendant who is **already incarcerated in DOC custody** throughout much of the case. In Wisconsin practice, these writs are commonly **transport/production writs** to secure the defendant’s presence (in person or by video) for hearings/trial/sentencing—**not** necessarily habeas litigation challenging custody. The clustering around major hearings (prelim, trial, sentencing, evidentiary hearing) supports that interpretation.

## 6) Motions pattern (types and when motion activity was highest)

### Motion types appearing
Most frequent/important motion categories in the docket:
- **Continuance / scheduling-related motions or requests**
  - e.g., motion for continuance (2018-03-06), repeated reset requests via letters
- **Motions in limine**
  - filed **2019-03-26** (and additional motions to exclude statements)
- **Motion to dismiss**
  - filed by defendant **2019-04-15**, litigated **2019-06-17** (denied)
- **Postconviction motions**
  - **2021-06-21** motion to vacate/dismiss for **speedy trial violation**
  - **2022-10-28** supplemental postconviction motion / motion to reconsider
- **Appellate procedural motions**
  - repeated **motions to extend time** (filed in COA) for postconviction deadlines and for circuit court decision deadlines

### Phase with highest motion activity
By volume, the **postconviction/appellate management phase (2020–2023)** shows the densest motion activity because of:
- repeated extension motions/orders,
- the main postconviction motion,
- supplemental motion on remand, and
- briefing/record/transcript management.

By “substantive trial litigation” motions, the peak is **2019 (pretrial leading into the December 2019 trial)** with motions in limine and the motion to dismiss.
