## 1) Time from offense date to sentencing date (years/months)

- **Offense date (both charges):** 2015-05-05  
- **Sentencing date:** 2020-02-24  

Elapsed time from **2015-05-05 → 2020-02-24**:
- **4 years, 9 months** (and **19 days**)

(Computed as 4 full years to 2019-05-05, plus 9 months to 2020-02-05, plus 19 days to 2020-02-24.)

## 2) Sentence components by charge (IC + ES), totals, and concurrency

### Charge 1 — Battery by Prisoners (940.20(1)), Felony H  
**Judgment action:** Found Guilty at Jury Trial  
**Sentence (02/24/2020):**
- **Initial confinement / prison:** **12 years**
- **Extended supervision:** **3 years**
- **Relationship:** **Consecutive to any other sentence currently serving** (i.e., consecutive to other cases/sentences)

**Total combined incarceration (IC + ES):** **15 years**  
**Concurrent/consecutive (within this case):** Charge 2 is ordered **concurrent with Ct. 1**, so Ct. 1 is the controlling sentence inside this case.

---

**Judgment action:** Found Guilty at Jury Trial  
**Sentence (02/24/2020):**

## 4) Total docket entries per year (2016–2025) and most active year

Counted from the provided docket entry list:

- **2016:** 31  
- **2017:** 12  
- **2018:** 21  
- **2019:** 26  
- **2020:** 21

- **2022:** 22  
- **2023:** 18  
- **2024:** 6  
- **2025:** 4  

**Most activity:** **2016 (31 entries)**

---

## 5) Appeal-related docket entries and percentage of total

Appeal-related = entries that reference **Court of Appeals** or **Supreme Court** (including “Order of Court of Appeals,” “Acknowledgment from Court of Appeals,” “Court of Appeals decision,” “Motion in court of appeals,” “Supreme Court decision,” etc.).

- **Appeal-related entries:** **27**
- **Total docket entries (all years):** **183**

**Percentage appeal-related:**  
- 27 / 183 ≈ **14.8%**

---

## 6) Receivables: totals due/paid/balance and % collected

Receivable record (single line item):
- **Amount due:** 761.00  
- **Paid:** 352.00  
- **Balance due:** 0.00  
- (Also shows **probAmt 409**, **adjust 0**, and **docCollected true**)

### Calculations
- **Total amount due:** **$761.00**
- **Total paid:** **$352.00**
- **Remaining balance (computed as due − paid):** **$409.00**
- **% collected (paid / due):** 352 / 761 ≈ **46.3%**

Important note: the receivable field **“balanceDue: 0”** conflicts with the arithmetic (**761 − 352 = 409**) and also conflicts with the presence of **probAmt = 409**. Based strictly on the numeric fields:
- **Collected:** $352  
- **Uncollected:** $409  
But WCCA’s “balanceDue” field here indicates **$0**, which may reflect a transfer/collection status, a different accounting bucket, or a data capture inconsistency.

## 7) Bond amount and bond-related docket entries (dates)

**Bond amount set:** **$5,000** (signature/recognizance bond with felony conditions)

Bond-related docket entries in the data:

1) **2016-02-11** — **“Signature bond set”** — **$5,000** (with felony conditions)  
2) **2016-02-25** — **“Signature bond signed”** — **$5,000**  
3) **2016-10-26** — Arraignment entry notes **“Bond continued.”** (no amount stated there, but it is bond-related)

If you want, I can also (a) break out “appeal-related” entries by Court of Appeals vs Supreme Court, or (b) compute attorney durations in whole-month rounding rules you specify (floor/ceil/nearest).
