## 4) King (urban) vs Ferry (rural): selected indicators
(All values are crude prevalence %, with 95% CI)

| Measure | King | Ferry | Difference (Ferry − King) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Smoking (CSMOKING)** | 7.2 (5.8–8.9) | 16.0 (13.5–19.0) | **+8.8** |
| **Obesity (OBESITY)** | 22.6 (20.4–24.9) | 40.2 (33.4–47.9) | **+17.6** |
| **Depression (DEPRESSION)** | 23.5 (21.7–25.3) | 25.0 (21.7–28.8) | +1.5 |
| **Lack of insurance (ACCESS2)** | 6.8 (5.5–8.4) | 8.5 (6.9–10.4) | +1.7 |

Key pattern: Ferry is substantially higher on **smoking** and **obesity**, modestly higher on **uninsurance**, and only slightly higher on **depression**.

## 5) Risk behavior with the **widest disparity** across counties (RISKBEH)
Computed as (max county value − min county value) for each risk behavior:

- **Binge drinking (BINGE):** max 17.9 (Whatcom) − min 14.0 (Ferry) = **3.9**
- **Smoking (CSMOKING):** max 16.0 (Ferry) − min 7.2 (King) = **8.8**
- **Physical inactivity (LPA):** max 27.9 (Yakima) − min 13.9 (King) = **14.0**
- **Short sleep (SLEEP):** max 37.0 (Pierce) − min 29.0 (King/Island) = **8.0**

**Widest disparity:** **Physical inactivity (LPA)** with a **14.0 percentage-point** spread (Yakima highest; King lowest).

## 6) Counties where **>3 health outcomes** exceed the 10-county average by **≥5 points**
I computed 10-county averages for each HLTHOUT measure (using the 10 counties shown) and then counted, per county, how many HLTHOUT measures were **≥ (average + 5.0)**.

### 10-county HLTHOUT averages (used for thresholding)
- ARTHRITIS 26.8; BPHIGH 32.5; CANCER 8.8; CASTHMA 11.0; CHD 6.3; COPD 6.0; DEPRESSION 25.1; DIABETES 10.7; HIGHCHOL 35.6; OBESITY 33.4; STROKE 3.4; TEETHLOST 10.7

### Counties exceeding the criterion (>3 measures ≥ avg+5)
- **Ferry County**: **8** measures exceed avg+5  
  (ARTHRITIS, BPHIGH, CANCER, CHD, COPD, DIABETES, HIGHCHOL, OBESITY)
- **Yakima County**: **4** measures exceed avg+5  
  (DIABETES, OBESITY, TEETHLOST, VISION is not HLTHOUT—so not counted; the 4 are **DIABETES, OBESITY, TEETHLOST,** and **GHLTH is not HLTHOUT**—therefore the qualifying HLTHOUT set is actually **3**?  
  Re-checking strictly HLTHOUT: Yakima exceeds by ≥5 on **DIABETES (12.9 vs 10.7), not ≥5**; that’s +2.2. **TEETHLOST 17.2 vs 10.7 = +6.5** qualifies; **OBESITY 39.7 vs 33.4 = +6.3** qualifies; others do not reach +5.  
  **Conclusion: Yakima does NOT meet >3.**

After strict HLTHOUT-only verification, **only Ferry County** has **more than 3** HLTHOUT measures that are ≥5 points above the 10-county average.

**Final result (Q6):** **Ferry County only**.
