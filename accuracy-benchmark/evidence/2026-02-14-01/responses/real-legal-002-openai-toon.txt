## 1) Charge progression (chargeHistory vs. final charges) + modifiers/enhancers

### Charge set over time
- **ChargeHistory shows only two charges at “Information Filed”** (i.e., the post-bindover charging document):
  1. **Battery by Prisoners** — **Wis. Stat. § 940.20(1)** — **Felony H**
  2. **Disorderly Conduct** — **Wis. Stat. § 947.01(1)** — **Misd. B**

### Final charges / outcomes (as disposed and sentenced)
- The **final charge set is the same two charges**; there is **no evidence in the provided chargeHistory of added or dropped counts** between information and final disposition.
- Both counts went to **jury trial** and resulted in **guilty verdicts** (with an important modifier difference on Count 2—see below).

### Modifiers (enhancers) applied and statutes referenced
**Count 1 — Battery by Prisoners (§ 940.20(1))**
- **Repeater** enhancer: **§ 939.62(1)(b)**
- **Use of a Dangerous Weapon** enhancer: **§ 939.63(1)(b)**
- Trial result reflects this: jury found **guilty on Count 1 “with the use of a dangerous weapon.”**

**Count 2 — Disorderly Conduct (§ 947.01(1))**
- **Repeater** enhancer: **§ 939.62(1)(a)**
- The judgment text indicates: **“With use of a dangerous weapon enhancer dismissed.”**
  - This implies a weapon enhancer was at least contemplated/charged at some point for Count 2, but **it was not part of the final conviction** on Count 2 (and the jury verdict entry explicitly says **guilty on Count 2 without the use of a dangerous weapon**).

**Bottom line on charge progression**
- **Counts remained stable (2 counts).**
- **Enhancer structure mattered most at disposition**:
  - Count 1: **Repeater + Dangerous Weapon** applied.
  - Count 2: **Repeater** applied; **weapon enhancer not sustained (dismissed / not convicted).**

2. **2024-10-07** — *Order of the Supreme Court* (text not shown)

- **Court of Appeals (2024-04-25)**: **reversed** JOC and denial orders; **remanded with direction to dismiss the complaint**.
- **Supreme Court**: accepted review and issued a decision (2025-06-27).  
  - **The docket text does not state whether the Supreme Court affirmed or reversed the Court of Appeals.** It only indicates a Supreme Court decision was filed. (To determine the final statewide outcome, you’d need the Supreme Court opinion/disposition language.)

## 4) Sentencing structure and supervision conditions (Ct 1 vs Ct 2)

### Count 1 (Battery by Prisoners, Felony H) — consecutive prison sentence
- **Initial confinement (IC):** **12 years**
- **Extended supervision (ES):** **3 years**
- **Concurrency:** **Consecutive to any other sentence currently serving**
- **Conditions listed under ES (and/or global conditions):**
  - **Costs**: civil judgment language if unpaid at discharge/revocation
  - **Other**:
    - **Submit DNA sample**
    - **No contact with the victim of this case**

### Count 2 (Disorderly Conduct, Misd. B) — concurrent to Count 1
- **IC:** **1 year**
- **ES:** **6 months**
- **Concurrency:** **Concurrent with Ct. 1**
- **Conditions:**
  - **Costs**: “Same conditions as Ct. 1.”
  - (No separate “Other” conditions are enumerated under Ct. 2 in the structured sentencing block; functionally it **inherits** Ct. 1’s conditions via the “same conditions” reference.)

### Key differences
- **Structure**: Ct. 1 is the controlling sentence (long, consecutive); Ct. 2 is **subordinate and concurrent**.
- **Condition specificity**: Ct. 1 explicitly lists **DNA submission** and **no-contact**; Ct. 2 references **same conditions** rather than restating them.

## 5) Habeas corpus activity: count and interpretation

### Count of habeas-related docket entries (from the provided docket list)
I counted **approximately 19 “Writ of Habeas Corpus” entries** (court-issued writs) in the docket entries shown:

- 2016: **3** (2/16 x2; 2/24; plus 6/8; 7/22) → actually **5** writ entries in 2016 shown
- 2018: **2** (2/23 x2)
- 2019: **1** (12/02)
- 2019–2020 sentencing: **1** (12/18) + **1 order** (2/20 is “Order,” not writ)
- 2021: **3** (8/17 x2; 11/02)

Additionally, there are many **“Petition for writ of habeas corpus”** entries (requests), often paired with **Proposed Order** and then the **Writ** itself. Petitions appear repeatedly (2016, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021).

### What the pattern suggests (in context)
- In Wisconsin circuit practice, these writs commonly function as **transport/production orders** to secure an **incarcerated defendant’s presence** (in-person or via video) for hearings/trial/sentencing/postconviction proceedings.
- The clustering around **scheduled hearings** (prelim, trial, sentencing, evidentiary hearings) suggests **logistical necessity**, not necessarily substantive “habeas litigation” challenging custody.
- Postconviction phase still required writs (e.g., 2021 evidentiary hearings), consistent with continued custody and the need to produce the defendant.

## 6) Motion practice pattern: most frequent types + when activity peaked

### Motion types appearing in the docket (examples)
- **Discovery-related**: demand for discovery; motion/demand for discovery (early 2016)
- **Continuance**: motion for continuance (notably 2018-03-06 leading to trial removal)
- **Motions in limine**: multiple filings **2019-03-26**
- **Motion to dismiss**: defendant motion to dismiss **2019-04-15** (heard/denied 2019-06-17)
- **Postconviction motions**:
  - Motion to vacate conviction/dismiss for speedy trial violation (2021-06-21)
  - Supplemental postconviction motion / motion to reconsider (2022-10-28)
- **Appellate procedural motions** (filed in COA but docketed here): repeated **motions to extend time** (2020–2023)

### When motion activity was highest
Two peaks:
1. **Pretrial-to-trial period (2018–mid 2019)**  
   - continuance motion, in limine motions, dismissal motion, scheduling-related litigation.
2. **Postconviction/appeal management (2020–2023)**  
   - numerous extension motions/orders and substantive postconviction motions (speedy trial claim + reconsideration).

If counting *volume*, the **2020–2023 appellate/postconviction period** is the densest due to repeated extension motions and related orders/transcript management.

- **2025-06-27** — **Supreme Court decision filed**
- **2025-09-05** — **Remittitur** (review case)

**Important limitation from the provided data:** the circuit docket clearly states the **Court of Appeals reversed and ordered dismissal on remand**, but it does **not** state the **Supreme Court’s final disposition** (affirm/reverse/modify). To complete the “final outcome” definitively, you’d need the Supreme Court opinion text or a docket line indicating the disposition (e.g., “affirmed,” “reversed,” “vacated”).
