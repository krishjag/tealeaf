# Analysis of Manhattan's Highest-Value Properties

## 1. Zoning District Distribution

**Zoning Frequency (zonedist1):**
- **C6-4**: 6 properties
- **C5-3**: 4 properties  
- **C5-2.5**: 4 properties
- **C6-6**: 3 properties
- **C6-5.5**: 2 properties
- **R7-2**: 2 properties
- **C6-7**: 1 property
- **M2-3**: 1 property
- **M1-5**: 1 property
- **R8**: 1 property
- Other C-districts: 5 properties

**Key Findings:**
- **26 of 30 properties (87%)** are in **Commercial (C) zones** - predominantly high-density zones (C5 and C6)
- **Only 2 properties (7%)** are in **Manufacturing (M) zones**:
  - NY Convention Center (M2-3) - public facility
  - 111 8th Avenue (M1-5) - Google's office building
- **4 properties (13%)** are in **Residential (R) zones**:
  - Stuyvesant Town (R7-2) - 8,764 residential units
  - Roosevelt Island residential (R7-2) - 8,018 units
  - American Museum of Natural History (PARK)
  - NY Presbyterian Hospital (R8)

**Zoning Implications:**
- **C6 districts** (highest density) dominate: allow FAR of 10-15, enabling supertall office towers
- **C5 districts** allow slightly lower density but still support major commercial development
- The presence of M-zone properties shows Manhattan's evolution from manufacturing to tech/commercial uses

## 6. Lot Coverage Analysis

**Calculating Coverage**: Building footprint (bldgfront × bldgdepth) ÷ lot area

**Highest Lot Coverage** (most intensive land use):

| **One Vanderbilt** | 44,048 SF | 43,345 SF | **98.4%** | Maximizes entire lot for supertall |
| **Empire State Building** | 91,351 SF | 84,150 SF | **92.1%** | Classic pre-war full-lot coverage |
| **666 Fifth Ave** | 61,755 SF | 63,000 SF | **102.0%*** | *Overhang/calculation anomaly |
| **767 Fifth Ave** | 84,350 SF | 63,147 SF | **74.9%** | Dense Midtown site |
| **9 W 57th St** | 62,058 SF | 50,292 SF | **81.0%** | Maximized corner lot |

**Lowest Lot Coverage** (minimal footprint vs lot size):

| Property | Lot Area | Coverage | Building Type |
|----------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Stuyvesant Town** | 2,675,000 SF | **10.3%** | 39 low-rise buildings with open space |
| **Roosevelt Island** | 4,227,757 SF | **0%** | 38 buildings, campus-style (no single footprint) |
| **American Museum** | 738,000 SF | **16.3%** | Park setting, 2 buildings |

| **NY Presbyterian** | 364,433 SF | **0%** | 6-building hospital campus |

**Patterns:**
- **Modern supertalls** (2010s): 90-98% coverage - maximize air rights with small footprints
- **Pre-war towers** (1930s): 80-92% coverage - filled entire lots
- **Campus developments**: <20% coverage - multiple buildings, open space required
- **Special purpose** (museums, hospitals, convention centers): 15-50% coverage

**FAR vs Coverage Insight**: High FAR (floor area ratio) buildings achieve density through HEIGHT with minimal lot coverage (One Vanderbilt: FAR 38.1, coverage 98%), while older buildings achieved density through larger floor plates and moderate height.
