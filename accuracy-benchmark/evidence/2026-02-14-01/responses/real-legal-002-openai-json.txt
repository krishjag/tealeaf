## 1) Charge progression (original vs. final; additions/drops/modifications; enhancers)

### Original charges (from `chargeHistory`)
Both original charges were later “replaced by: Information Filed,” meaning the complaint-stage charges carried forward into the formal Information without showing additional/different counts in the provided data.

1. **Count 1**: Battery by Prisoners  
   - **Statute**: **Wis. Stat. § 940.20(1)**  
   - **Severity**: **Felony H**

2. **Count 2**: Disorderly Conduct  
   - **Statute**: **Wis. Stat. § 947.01(1)**  
   - **Severity**: **Misd. B**

### Final charges (as convicted and sentenced)
The final “charges” list matches the two original counts (no new counts appear in the dataset; none are shown as dismissed outright).

1. **Count 1**: Battery by Prisoners  
   - **Statute**: **§ 940.20(1)**  
   - **Disposition**: **Found Guilty at Jury Trial** (verdict 2019-12-04; judgment entered)  
   - **Modifiers/Enhancers applied**:
     - **Repeater** — **§ 939.62(1)(b)**
     - **Use of a Dangerous Weapon** — **§ 939.63(1)(b)**

2. **Count 2**: Disorderly Conduct  
   - **Statute**: **§ 947.01(1)**  
   - **Disposition**: **Found Guilty at Jury Trial**  
   - **Modifiers/Enhancers**:
     - **Repeater** — **§ 939.62(1)(a)**
   - **Modification noted at judgment**: “**With use of a dangerous weapon enhancer dismissed.**”  
     - This indicates the case contemplated/charged a dangerous-weapon enhancer for Count 2 at some point, but **it was not part of the final conviction/sentencing on Count 2**.

### Net change summary
- **Counts added/dropped**: **No additional counts** appear; **no counts dropped** (both counts resulted in guilty verdicts).
- **Enhancers**:
  - Count 1: **Repeater + Dangerous Weapon enhancer applied**.
  - Count 2: **Repeater applied**; **Dangerous Weapon enhancer dismissed** (not part of final conviction).

## 3) Appellate docket entries (Court of Appeals + Supreme Court) and trajectory/outcome

Below are the entries that are explicitly appellate-level (or clearly reflect appellate proceedings) in chronological order:

### Court of Appeals-related entries
- **2020-06-11**: Motion filed by appellate attorney (extend time for appointing postconviction counsel/ordering transcripts)
- **2020-06-15**: **Order of Court of Appeals** extending SPD deadline (through May 20, 2020)
- **2020-10-27**: **Order of Court of Appeals** extending time to file postconviction motion/NOA (to Dec 21, 2020)
- **2020-12-23**: **Order of Court of Appeals** extending time (to Feb 19, 2021)
- **2021-02-22**: **Order of Court of Appeals** extending time (to Apr 20, 2021)
- **2021-04-21**: **Order of Court of Appeals** extending time (to Jun 21, 2021)

(After postconviction motion filed and pending decision:)
- **2021-10-19**: **Order of Court of Appeals** extending time for circuit court to decide postconviction motion (to Dec 20, 2021)
- **2021-12-14**: **Order of Court of Appeals** extending time to decide (to Mar 14, 2022)
- **2022-03-14**: **Order of Court of Appeals** extending time to decide (to May 31, 2022)

(Direct appeal begins:)
- **2022-06-07**: Acknowledgment from Court of Appeals (NOA received)
- **2022-09-30**: **Order of Court of Appeals** retaining jurisdiction but **remanding** for **supplemental postconviction motion** (due 10/31/2022) and setting return/briefing mechanics
- **2023-01-10**: **Order of Court of Appeals** extending circuit court deadline to decide pending postconviction motion (to May 22, 2023)
- **2023-06-01**: **Order of Court of Appeals** extending time to file appellant’s brief (after record return)
- **2023-06-26**: **Order of Court of Appeals** re transmittal of record (due within 11 days)
- **2024-04-25**: **Court of Appeals decision & order reversing**  
  - Text: “**Reverse the Judgment of Conviction and Circuit Court Orders Denying Postconviction Motions and remand for the Circuit Court to Dismiss the Complaint**”

### Supreme Court-related entries
- **2024-05-28**: **Acknowledgment from Supreme Court** (“for Review - Supreme Court”) (i.e., petition for review stage)
- **2024-10-07**: **Order of the Supreme Court**
- **2024-11-11**: **Order of the Supreme Court** granting motion; State’s opening brief due **12/06/2024**
- **2025-01-03**: **Order of the Supreme Court** accepting defendant’s brief for filing
- **2025-06-27**: **Supreme Court decision filed** (“Review of Decision of the Court of Appeals/Supreme Court decision”)
- **2025-09-05**: **Remittitur** (petition for review case)

### Trajectory and outcome (as reflected in this circuit docket)
- Circuit court conviction and sentence (2020) → postconviction speedy-trial litigation denied (2022; again denied on supplemental/reconsideration in 2023) → **Court of Appeals reverses and orders dismissal of the complaint** (2024-04-25) → **Supreme Court review granted/briefed and decided** (decision filed 2025-06-27) → remittitur 2025-09-05.
- The circuit docket does not include the Supreme Court decision’s holding text; it only shows that a decision was filed. So, from this dataset alone, the **clearest stated merits outcome** is the **Court of Appeals reversal/remand to dismiss** (4/25/2024), followed by Supreme Court review and final decision in 2025.

## 4) Sentencing structure and supervision conditions (Ct 1 vs Ct 2)

### Count 1 (Battery by Prisoners; repeater; dangerous weapon)
- **Initial Confinement (State Prison)**: **12 years**
  - **Consecutive to**: “**Any other sentence currently serving**”
- **Extended Supervision**: **3 years**
  - **Consecutive to**: “Any other sentence currently serving”
- **Conditions listed under ES**:
  - **Costs**: civil judgment language if revoked/discharged with unpaid obligations
  - **Other**:
    - **Submit DNA sample**
    - **No contact with the victim**

### Count 2 (Disorderly Conduct; repeater; DW enhancer dismissed)
- **Initial Confinement (State Prison)**: **1 year**
  - **Concurrent with**: **Count 1**
- **Extended Supervision**: **6 months**
  - **Concurrent with**: **Count 1**
- **Conditions listed under ES**:
  - **Costs**: “Same conditions as Ct. 1.”

### Differences in conditions
- **Count 1 explicitly includes** DNA submission and no-contact (and costs language).
- **Count 2 incorporates costs conditions by reference** (“same as Ct. 1”) but does **not separately restate** DNA/no-contact in the structured “conditions” list—though the sentencing hearing narrative also states **“No contact with the victim of this case”** as part of the overall sentence package.

## 5) Habeas corpus activity (count and interpretation)

### Count of habeas-related docket entries
Counting entries with description **“Writ of Habeas Corpus”** or **“Petition for writ of habeas corpus”** in the provided docket:

**2016**
- 2016-02-16: Writ (for 2/25/16)
- 2016-02-16: Writ (for 2/18/16)
- 2016-02-24: Writ (for 3/3/16)
- 2016-03-14: Writ (for 5/10/16)
- 2016-06-08: Writ (for 7/20/16)
- 2016-07-22: Writ
- 2016-08-10: Petition
- 2016-08-17: Petition

**2018**
- 2018-02-22: Petition
- 2018-02-22: Petition
- 2018-02-23: Writ
- 2018-02-23: Writ

**2019**
- 2019-12-02: Writ
- 2019-12-02: Petition

**2019-2020 sentencing transport**
- 2019-12-17: Petition
- 2019-12-18: Writ
- 2020-02-17: Petition
- 2020-02-20: Order (not counted as writ/petition)
- (2020-02-17 also has “Proposed Order”)

**2021 postconviction hearings**
- 2021-08-16: Petition (GBCI)
- 2021-08-16: Petition (WSPF)
- 2021-08-17: Writ (WSPF)
- 2021-08-17: Writ (GBCI)
- 2021-10-27: Petition (GBCI)
- 2021-11-02: Writ (GBCI)

**Total (writs + petitions)**: **24** habeas-related filings/entries (as counted above).

### What the pattern suggests
- The writs/petitions cluster around **in-custody court appearances** (prelim/arraignment, trial, sentencing, evidentiary hearings). In Wisconsin circuit practice, these are commonly used to **secure the defendant’s presence from DOC custody** (transport/production orders), not necessarily “habeas” as a substantive collateral attack.
- The frequency here reflects (1) the defendant’s continuous incarceration in multiple institutions and (2) the case’s **very long pretrial and postconviction lifespan**, requiring repeated production for hearings.

---

## 6) Motions pattern (types and when motion activity was highest)

### Motion types appearing most often (by theme)
1. **Continuance / scheduling-related motions and requests**
   - Motion for continuance (2018-03-06) and multiple scheduling conferences/resets
   - Numerous letters requesting resets (functionally motion practice)

2. **Motions in limine (pretrial/trial)**
   - 2019-03-26: motions in limine and additional motions to exclude statements

3. **Dismissal / speedy trial litigation**
   - 2018-09-26: demand for speedy trial
   - 2019-04-15: motion to dismiss (denied 2019-06-17)
   - 2021-06-21: postconviction motion to vacate/dismiss for speedy trial violation
   - 2022-10-28: supplemental postconviction motion / motion to reconsider
   - 2023: briefing on reconsideration; denial

4. **Appellate extension motions**
   - Multiple motions to extend deadlines for postconviction motion/notice of appeal and for circuit court decision deadlines (reflected as COA orders)

### Phase with highest motion activity
- **Postconviction + appellate management phase (2020–2023)** shows the densest concentration of formal motion practice:
  - repeated **extensions** (COA orders responding to motions),
  - the main postconviction motion,
  - evidentiary hearing,
  - supplemental motion on remand and reconsideration litigation.
- A secondary peak is **2019 pretrial/trial lead-up**, with motions in limine and the motion to dismiss.
