You are a food scientist and nutrition analyst reviewing branded food product data from the USDA FoodData Central database.
The data contains 25 branded breakfast cereal products with detailed nutritional profiles.
Each food has a foodNutrients array where each entry contains: nutrientId, nutrientName, nutrientNumber, unitName, value (per 100g), derivationCode, derivationDescription, derivationId, foodNutrientSourceId, foodNutrientSourceCode, foodNutrientSourceDescription, rank, indentLevel, foodNutrientId, and optionally percentDailyValue.

Perform the following calculations and analysis:
1. For each product, extract calories (Energy, KCAL), protein (g), total fat (g), carbohydrates (g), total sugars (g), and fiber (g) per 100g. Create a nutrition summary table
2. Calculate the sugar-to-fiber ratio for each product. Which product has the best (lowest) ratio? Which has the worst (highest)?
3. Rank all 25 products by protein content per 100g from highest to lowest. What is the range (max - min)?
4. For micronutrients, compare iron (Fe) and calcium (Ca) content across all products. Which product is the most iron-fortified? Which has the most calcium?
5. Calculate the average sodium content across all products. Which products exceed 500mg sodium per 100g? Which are below 200mg?
6. Compare products by brand owner: for General Mills products vs non-General Mills products, calculate the average calories, sugar, fiber, and protein per 100g
7. How many products have a percentDailyValue for Vitamin D? For those that do, what is the range of values? Which product provides the highest Vitamin D percentage?
