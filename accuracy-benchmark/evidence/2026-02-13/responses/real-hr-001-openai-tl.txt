## 1) Average monthly job openings (JO) level and hires (HI) level, 2025 (thousands)

| Industry | Avg JO level | Avg HI level |
|---|---:|---:|
| Total nonfarm | 7,351.5 | 5,333.9 |
| Total private | 6,515.8 | 4,988.6 |
| Construction | 250.3 | 343.4 |
| Manufacturing | 421.3 | 298.6 |
| Retail trade | 588.2 | 589.7 |
| Information | 151.3 | 84.6 |
| Financial activities | 403.3 | 210.5 |
| Professional and business services | 1,287.0 | 1,022.3 |
| Health care and social assistance | 1,409.5 | 726.0 |

| Accommodation and food services | 890.2 | 798.0 |
| Government | 807.8 | 337.2 |

## 2) Job openings-to-hires ratio (Avg JO / Avg HI). Highest = “hardest to fill”

| Industry | JO/HI ratio |
|---|---:|
| Financial activities | 1.92 |
| Information | 1.79 |
| Health care and social assistance | 1.94 |
| Professional and business services | 1.26 |
| Manufacturing | 1.41 |
| Government | 2.40 |
| Construction | 0.73 |
| Retail trade | 1.00 |
| Leisure and hospitality | 1.06 |
| Accommodation and food services | 1.12 |
| Total private | 1.31 |
| Total nonfarm | 1.38 |

**Highest ratio:** **Government (2.40)** — highest average openings relative to hires.

*(Next highest: Health care & social assistance at 1.94; Financial activities at 1.92.)*

## 3) Average (Quit rate − Layoff/Discharge rate), percentage points. Ranked high → low

This is averaged over months using rates: **avg(QU rate − LD rate)**.

| Rank | Industry | Avg (QU − LD), pp |
|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | Accommodation and food services | **+3.25** |
| 2 | Leisure and hospitality | **+2.75** |
| 3 | Retail trade | **+1.58** |
| 4 | Health care and social assistance | **+1.33** |
| 5 | Total private | **+1.02** |
| 6 | Total nonfarm | **+0.90** |
| 7 | Financial activities | **+0.72** |
| 8 | Manufacturing | **+0.52** |
| 9 | Government | **+0.44** |
| 10 | Information | **−0.02** |
| 11 | Professional and business services | **−0.03** |
| 12 | Construction | **−0.08** |

Interpretation: Accommodation/food and leisure/hospitality have much more **voluntary** than **involuntary** turnover; construction is slightly the opposite on average in 2025.

## 4) Total nonfarm month-over-month change in JO level (thousands)

JO levels (k): Jan 7762, Feb 7480, Mar 7200, Apr 7395, May 7712, Jun 7357, Jul 7208, Aug 7227, Sep 7658, Oct 7449, Nov 6928, Dec 6542.

MoM changes (k):
- **Feb:** −282  
- **Mar:** −280  
- **Apr:** +195  
- **May:** +317  
- **Jun:** −355  
- **Jul:** −149  
- **Aug:** +19  
- **Sep:** +431  
- **Oct:** −209  
- **Nov:** −521  
- **Dec:** −386  

**Largest increase:** **September (+431k)** (Aug → Sep)  
**Largest decrease:** **November (−521k)** (Oct → Nov)

## 5) Check: TS level ≈ QU + LD + OS (levels), by industry (rounding)

For each industry/month, JOLTS total separations are designed to equal quits + layoffs/discharges + other separations, with small differences possible due to rounding (levels are in thousands).

Using the provided levels, the identity holds **exactly** (within the displayed rounding) for all industries across 2025. Examples:
- **Total nonfarm, Jan:** QU 3256 + LD 1674 + OS 342 = **5272**, matches TS **5272**
- **Construction, Jul:** 90 + 212 + 14 = **316**, matches TS **316**
- **Information, Feb:** 30 + 47 + 7 = **84**, matches TS **85**?  
  Actually Feb Information TS is **85** and components sum to **84** (30+47+7). This is a **1k rounding difference**, consistent with BLS rounding in published levels.

So: **matches within rounding**, with occasional ±1 (thousand) discrepancies.

## 6) Highest average quit rate and highest average layoff rate

Average quit rates (percent of employment), 2025:
- **Highest avg quit rate:** **Accommodation and food services (~4.32%)**
  - Next: Leisure and hospitality (~4.00%)

Average layoff/discharge rates:
- **Highest avg layoff rate:** **Construction (~2.08%)**
  - Next: Professional & business services (~1.97%), Leisure & hospitality (~1.40%)

## 7) Private sector vs Government: average hire, quit, and layoff rates

Averaging monthly rates:

| Sector | Avg hire rate | Avg quit rate | Avg layoff rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Total private** | **3.68%** | **2.22%** | **1.20%** |
| **Government** | **1.43%** | **0.77%** | **0.33%** |

**Comparison:** **Total private is higher on all three**—hire rates, quit rates, and layoff/discharge rates—than Government on average in 2025.

If you want, I can also provide (a) the same averages for rates (JO rate, HI rate, TS rate) by industry, or (b) confidence-style discussion of what a high JO/HI ratio vs high (QU−LD) implies about recruiting frictions and worker bargaining power by sector.
