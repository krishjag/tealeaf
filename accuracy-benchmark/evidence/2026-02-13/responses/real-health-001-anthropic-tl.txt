## 4. Urban vs. Rural Comparison: King County vs. Ferry County

| Measure | King (Urban) | Ferry (Rural) | Rural Disadvantage |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Current Smoking** | 7.2% (5.8-8.9) | 16.0% (13.5-19.0) | +8.8 points (122% higher) |
| **Obesity** | 22.6% (20.4-24.9) | 40.2% (33.4-47.9) | +17.6 points (78% higher) |
| **Depression** | 23.5% (21.7-25.3) | 25.0% (21.7-28.8) | +1.5 points (6% higher) |
| **Lack of Insurance** | 6.8% (5.5-8.4) | 8.5% (6.9-10.4) | +1.7 points (25% higher) |

**Critical Insight:** The rural-urban health divide is most pronounced in obesity and smoking, while depression rates are relatively similar. Ferry County faces substantially worse outcomes despite similar insurance coverage rates.

## 5. Health Risk Behavior with Widest Disparity

**Physical Inactivity (LPA)** shows the widest disparity:
- **Highest:** Yakima County - 27.9% (24.2-31.7)
- **Lowest:** King County - 13.9% (12.1-15.8)
- **Range:** 14.0 percentage points

**Other RISKBEH disparities:**
- Current Smoking: 8.8 point range (Ferry 16.0% vs King 7.2%)
- Short Sleep Duration: 7.9 point range (Pierce 37.0% vs Whatcom 29.1%)
- Binge Drinking: 3.7 point range (Whatcom 17.9% vs Island 14.2%)

## 6. Counties Exceeding 10-County Average by 5+ Points (3+ Outcomes)

**10-County Averages for HLTHOUT measures:**
- Arthritis: 26.8% | High Blood Pressure: 32.5% | Cancer: 8.8%
- Asthma: 11.0% | CHD: 6.3% | COPD: 6.0%
- Depression: 25.1% | Diabetes: 10.7% | High Cholesterol: 35.8%

**Ferry County** (smallest, most rural - pop. 7,497) exceeds average by 5+ points in **4 measures**:
1. Arthritis: 38.0% (+11.2 points above average)
2. High Blood Pressure: 41.1% (+8.6 points)
3. High Cholesterol: 41.2% (+5.4 points)
4. Obesity: 40.2% (+6.8 points)

**No other counties** meet the threshold of 3+ outcomes exceeding the average by 5+ percentage points.

## Summary Insights

1. **The "Big Three":** High cholesterol, high blood pressure, and obesity dominate as the most prevalent health outcomes across nearly all counties.

2. **Rural Health Crisis:** Ferry County, the smallest and most rural, shows alarming rates across multiple indicators, particularly chronic diseases and behavioral risk factors.

3. **Urban Advantage:** King County (Seattle metro) consistently shows the best health outcomes, particularly in obesity, diabetes, and smoking rates.

4. **Physical Inactivity Gap:** The 14-point disparity in physical inactivity between Yakima and King counties represents the largest behavioral risk factor gap and likely contributes to obesity and diabetes disparities.

5. **Preventive Care Access:** Despite health outcome disparities, preventive service utilization (screenings, checkups) is relatively consistent across counties, suggesting the disparities are driven more by social determinants and behavioral factors than healthcare access alone.
