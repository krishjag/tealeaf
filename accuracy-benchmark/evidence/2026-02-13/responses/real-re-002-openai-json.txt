I can analyze all 30, but the JSON you provided is truncated (it contains **~25 records**, ending at block 783 lot 70). Below are results for the **records shown**; if you paste the remaining lots I’ll recompute everything for the full 30.

## 1) Zoning district distribution (zonedist1) + what it permits; M vs C vs R

### Most frequent `zonedist1` (in the provided records)
- **C6-4** (appears multiple times): large-scale **commercial mixed-use** district (high-density commercial; often allows significant office/hotel/residential depending on overlays/special districts and mapped FAR rules).
- **C5-2.5 / C5-3** (multiple): **Midtown core commercial** districts—prime office/retail/hotel; very high density, often with special district controls (MiD).
- **C6-6 / C6-5.5 / C6-6.5 / C6-7** (multiple): very high-density commercial districts (Midtown/Times Sq corridor), typically enabling major office towers and mixed-use.
- Less common: **R7-2**, **R8**, **M1-5**, **M2-3**, **PARK**.

### M vs C vs R zoning (zonedist1)
**Manufacturing zones (M):**
- **360 WEST STREET** – `M2-3` (landuse 8, bldgclass P9; convention center type).  
- **111 8 AVENUE** – `M1-5` (landuse 5, bldgclass O6; large office in a light manufacturing district—common in Manhattan where older loft/manufacturing districts transitioned to office).

**Commercial zones (C):** (dominant among high assessed values)
Examples:
- **185 GREENWICH STREET** `C6-4` (also split with `C5-3`)
- **761 5 AVENUE** `C5-3` (split with `C5-2.5`)
- **1111 AVE OF THE AMER** `C6-6` (split with `C6-5.5`/`C6-7`)
- **One Vanderbilt (51 E 42 ST)** `C5-3`
- **Rockefeller Center parcels** `C5-2.5` / `C6-5.5` / etc.
- **Hudson Yards area** `C6-4` with `spdist1=HY`

**Residential zones (R):**
- **240 1 AVENUE** `R7-2` (overlay C1-5) — large residential complex with some commercial.
- **MAIN STREET (Roosevelt Island)** `R7-2` — residential + retail.
- **180 FT WASHINGTON AVENUE** `R8` — institutional/hospital use in a residential district.

**Special / other:**
- **200 CENTRAL PARK WEST** `PARK` — museum/cultural facility.

**Interpretation:** These top-assessed Manhattan lots are overwhelmingly in **high-density commercial districts (C5/C6)**, consistent with trophy office towers and major mixed-use complexes. A small number are in **M** districts (often legacy zoning in areas that now function as office/commercial), and a few are **R** districts tied to very large residential/institutional campuses.

## 2) Building age profile by decade + relationship to assessed value (avg per decade)

Using `yearbuilt` from the provided records, grouped by decade; assessed value is `assesstot`.

### Average assessed value by decade (provided records)
- **1930s** (1930–1939): avg **$522.7M**  
  (examples include Empire State Building 1931; Rockefeller-era buildings; 1930 hospital building)
- **1940s**: avg **$791.8M**  
  (dominated by the very large 1945 residential complex at 240 1 AVE)
- **1950s**: avg **$449.8M**
- **1960s**: avg **$569.8M**
- **1970s**: avg **$528.7M**
- **1980s**: avg **$520.0M** (only one record shown: 388 Greenwich)
- **1990s**: avg **$474.4M**
- **2000s**: avg **$1,087.4M**  
  (driven heavily by **185 Greenwich (2009)** at **$1.67B** plus other major 2000s towers/condos)
- **2010s**: avg **$627.7M**

### Relationship: newer = higher?
- **Not monotonic.** The **2000s** are highest on average in this subset because they include an extreme outlier (185 Greenwich / WTC complex lot).
- **2010s** are high but not the highest on average; however, several **2015–2019** Hudson Yards-era towers show very high FAR and high assessments.
- Many **1930s–1970s** Midtown office towers still carry **very high assessments**, reflecting location and income potential more than age.

**Takeaway:** In Manhattan, **location + allowed density + building class/use** often dominate assessed value; age matters, but trophy prewar and mid-century towers remain extremely valuable.

## 3) Area composition (% of bldgarea) + most mixed-use vs single-purpose

For each property, compute shares:
- Commercial share ≈ `comarea / bldgarea`
- Residential share ≈ `resarea / bldgarea`
- Office share ≈ `officearea / bldgarea`
- Retail share ≈ `retailarea / bldgarea`
- “Other” share ≈ (`otherarea` + storage/garage/etc where present) / `bldgarea` (PLUTO’s categories overlap conceptually; office/retail are typically subsets of commercial area, so treat office/retail as composition within commercial).

### Most mixed-use (multiple area types > 0)
Clear mixed-use examples in the provided records:
- **1 COLUMBUS CIRCLE (Time Warner Center Condo)**: office + retail + residential + garage + other.
- **240 1 AVENUE**: overwhelmingly residential but has commercial + office + retail + garage.
- **MAIN STREET (Roosevelt Island)**: residential + retail + small office + garage + other.
- **151 E 58 ST (One Beacon Court Condo)**: office + retail + residential.
- **1260 AVE OF THE AMER**: office + retail + large “other” component.
- **185 GREENWICH STREET**: office + retail + other (no residential).

### Mostly single-purpose (dominant one use)
- Many `O4` office towers: **comarea ~ bldgarea** and **officearea ~ bldgarea**, with small retail.
  - Examples: **427 10 AVE**, **527 W 34 ST**, **388 Greenwich**, **111 8 AVE** (office-only).
- Institutional/special:
  - **360 WEST STREET (Convention Center)**: commercial area but functionally institutional/event + storage/other.
  - **200 CENTRAL PARK WEST**: “other” dominates (museum/cultural).

If you want, I can output a table per property with exact percentages; it’s straightforward but lengthy.

## 4) `numfloors` vs `bldgarea`; average floor plate size; largest floor plates; pattern by building class

Average floor plate size = `bldgarea / numfloors`.

### Largest floor plates (provided records)
Very large floor plates are generally **low-rise campus / convention / institutional** properties:
- **360 WEST STREET (P9)**: 4,060,596 / 4 ≈ **1,015,149 sf/floor**
- **240 1 AVENUE (D7)**: 8,942,176 / 13 ≈ **687,860 sf/floor**
- **MAIN STREET (D4)**: 4,786,701 / 18 ≈ **265,928 sf/floor**
- **111 8 AVENUE (O6)**: 2,161,994 / 17 ≈ **127,176 sf/floor**
- **185 GREENWICH STREET (O4)**: 8,966,500 / 104 ≈ **86,216 sf/floor** (still huge despite height)

### Pattern by building class
- **P9 / D7 / D4 / I1** (large facilities, campuses, institutions) → **very large floor plates** and/or low-rise massing.
- **O4** (office towers) → typically **smaller floor plates** (often ~30k–80k sf/floor here), reflecting high-rise cores and slenderer towers in Midtown.
- **RC / RM** (condo/mixed towers) → mid floor plates, often with mixed program.

## 5) Top 5 owners by total assessed value; concentration; repeat owners

From the provided records, the biggest owners by **sum of assesstot** (noting many “UNAVAILABLE OWNER” entries):

1. **LOWER MANHATTAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION** — **$1.673B** (185 Greenwich)
2. **NEW YORK CONVENTION CENTER** — **$931.4M** (360 West)
3. **TIME WARNER CENTER CONDOMINIUM** — **$794.4M**
4. **BPP ST OWNER LLC** — **$791.8M**
5. **767 FIFTH PARTNERS LLC** — **$791.1M**

**Do owners repeat?**
- In the shown subset, most named owners appear once.
- **“UNAVAILABLE OWNER”** appears **multiple times** and would be highly ranked if treated as a single owner entity (but it’s a placeholder, not a true consolidated owner).

**Concentration:** Extremely top-heavy: the #1 lot alone is ~**$1.67B**, far above the rest. Beyond that, values cluster in the ~$440M–$800M range.

## 6) Lot vs building dimensions; lot coverage ratio; most/least coverage

Lot coverage ratio (approx) = `(bldgfront * bldgdepth) / lotarea`.  
Caveats: PLUTO `bldgfront/bldgdepth` can be zero/missing for some complex sites; footprint for towers with setbacks/podiums is not well captured by a simple rectangle.

### Highest coverage (among those with nonzero bldgfront & bldgdepth)
- **360 WEST STREET**: 1227.5 * 389 / 962,250 ≈ **0.50**
- **111 8 AVENUE**: 207 * 800 / 165,200 ≈ **1.00** (essentially full-block coverage; consistent with a large loft/block building)
- **338 5 AVENUE (Empire State Building lot record)**: 198 * 425 / 91,351 ≈ **0.92**
- **500 W 33 ST**: 365 * 521 / 198,898 ≈ **0.96**
- **250 W 34 ST**: 647 * 197 / 127,966 ≈ **1.00**

### Lowest coverage (with valid dimensions)
- **185 GREENWICH STREET**: 200 * 198 / 833,945 ≈ **0.05**  
  (makes sense: huge lot area with multiple buildings/open space; record shows 9 buildings and a very large site)

**Note:** Several records have `bldgfront=0` or `bldgdepth=0` (e.g., 527 W 34, MAIN STREET, One Beacon Court), so coverage can’t be computed reliably for those without alternative footprint data.

## 7) Geographic clustering (lat/long): Midtown vs Lower Manhattan vs other; relationship to type/value

Using latitude bands you suggested:

### Lower Manhattan (≈ 40.70–40.72)
- **185 Greenwich St** (40.7116) — mega office/mixed complex, highest assessed in list.
- **388 Greenwich St** (40.7209) — large office.

**Pattern:** Lower Manhattan entries here are **very high-value office** properties in C6-4-type districts.

### Midtown core (≈ 40.75–40.76)
A large share of the list clusters here:
- Avenue of the Americas / Rockefeller Center / Bryant Park / Lexington corridor (many `C5-*` / `C6-*`, `spdist1=MiD`)
- Hudson Yards edge (40.753–40.755) with `spdist1=HY`

**Pattern:** Midtown cluster is dominated by **office towers (O4/RC)** with high FAR and significant retail at base; these make up the bulk of high-assessed lots.

### Other areas
- **Upper West Side / Central Park West**: 200 Central Park West (40.7813) — cultural facility (PARK zoning).
- **Roosevelt Island**: MAIN STREET (40.7662 but longitude -73.9459) — large residential campus.
- **Washington Heights**: 180 Ft Washington (40.8407) — hospital/institutional.

**Relationship between location and type/value**
- **Midtown & Lower Manhattan**: highest concentration of **commercial office** and the highest assessments.
- **Outer Manhattan neighborhoods** in this set appear mainly as **institutional or very large residential campuses**—still high assessed, but generally below the top Midtown/L.M. trophy office outliers.
