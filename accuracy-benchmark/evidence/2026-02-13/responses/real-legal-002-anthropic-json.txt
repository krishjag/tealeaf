# COMPREHENSIVE CASE ANALYSIS
## State of Wisconsin v. Luis A Ramirez #244212
### Columbia County Case No. 2016CF000031

---

## 1. CHARGE PROGRESSION ANALYSIS

### Original vs. Final Charges

**Both charges remained substantively identical from complaint through trial:**

| Charge | Description | Statute | Severity |
|--------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Count 1 | Battery by Prisoners | 940.20(1) | Felony H |
| Count 2 | Disorderly Conduct | 947.01(1) | Misdemeanor B |

### Charge Modifiers (Enhancers) Applied

**Count 1 - Battery by Prisoners:**
- **Modifier 1**: Repeater - §939.62(1)(b) 
- **Modifier 2**: Use of a Dangerous Weapon - §939.63(1)(b)
- **Trial Outcome**: Jury found defendant guilty WITH dangerous weapon enhancer

**Count 2 - Disorderly Conduct:**
- **Modifier 1**: Repeater - §939.62(1)(a)
- **Trial Outcome**: Jury found defendant guilty, but dangerous weapon enhancer was **DISMISSED**

**Key Finding**: The charges themselves never changed, but the penalty enhancers significantly increased potential sentences. The repeater statute (§939.62) allows for increased maximum sentences for repeat offenders. The dangerous weapon enhancer (§939.63) on Count 1 further increased sentencing exposure.

```

### Critical Timeline Issues

**Pre-Trial Phase (Most Problematic):**
- Trial scheduled and reset **FIVE times**:
  1. April 13, 2017 → Reset (witness unavailable)
  2. September 26, 2017 → Reset (conflict)
  3. April 4, 2018 → Reset (defense continuance)
  4. April 3, 2019 → Reset (motions in limine filed)
  5. December 3, 2019 → **TRIAL HELD**

- **September 26, 2018**: Defendant filed **Demand for Speedy Trial**
- **Time from demand to trial**: ~15 months
- **Total pre-trial delay**: 3 years, 10 months from filing

This excessive delay ultimately became grounds for reversal.

## 3. APPELLATE TRAJECTORY - COMPLETE CHRONOLOGY

### COURT OF APPEALS ACTIVITY

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **June 2, 2022** | Notice of Appeal filed | Attorney Jennifer Lohr initiates appeal |
| June 7, 2022 | Acknowledgment received | COA accepts jurisdiction |
| June 15, 2020 | Extension order | Deadline for appointing post-conviction counsel extended |
| July-Sept 2022 | Record transmitted | Circuit court record and transcripts sent to COA |
| **Sept 30, 2022** | **Remand Order** | COA retains jurisdiction; remands for supplemental post-conviction motion |
| Oct 28, 2022 | Supplemental motion filed | Defendant files motion to reconsider |
| Jan 10, 2023 | Extension granted | Circuit court deadline extended to May 22, 2023 |
| May 16, 2023 | Circuit court denies motion | Supplemental motion denied after oral ruling |
| June 23, 2023 | Supplemental record transmitted | Post-remand proceedings sent to COA |
| **April 25, 2024** | **DECISION: REVERSED** | **COA reverses conviction; remands to circuit court to DISMISS complaint** |

### SUPREME COURT ACTIVITY

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **May 28, 2024** | Petition for Review filed | State seeks Supreme Court review of COA reversal |
| June 6, 2024 | Status conference | Circuit court holds status conference pending Supreme Court decision |
| Oct 7, 2024 | Order issued | Supreme Court procedural order |
| Nov 11, 2024 | Briefing schedule set | Motion granted; State's opening brief due Dec 6, 2024 |
| Jan 3, 2025 | Brief accepted | Defendant's brief accepted for filing |
| **June 27, 2025** | **SUPREME COURT DECISION** | Final decision issued (specifics not detailed in record) |
| Sept 5, 2025 | Remittitur issued | Formal mandate returned to circuit court |
| **Oct 2, 2025** | **Notice of Completion** | Attorney Lohr withdrawn; case concluded |

### Appellate Outcome Analysis

**Three-Level Appellate Journey:**

1. **Circuit Court Post-Conviction**: Motion denied (May 13, 2022)
2. **Court of Appeals**: Conviction **REVERSED**, remanded to dismiss (April 25, 2024)
3. **Supreme Court Review**: Decision issued (June 27, 2025); case ultimately concluded with Notice of Completion

**The progression indicates:**
- The Court of Appeals found merit in the speedy trial violation claim (initially raised April 15, 2019)
- The State contested this reversal via Supreme Court petition
- The ultimate outcome (based on Notice of Completion and remittitur) appears to favor the reversal, as the case concluded rather than being remanded for retrial

## 4. SENTENCING STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

### Count 1: Battery by Prisoners (Felony H with enhancers)

**Incarceration:**
- **Initial Confinement**: 12 years
- **Extended Supervision**: 3 years
- **Total Bifurcated Sentence**: 15 years
- **Consecutive Provision**: "Consecutive to: Any other sentence currently serving"

**Conditions:**
1. **Financial**: $518.00 costs; if probation revoked or discharged with obligations due, civil judgment entered
2. **Biological Evidence**: Submit DNA sample
3. **Protective Order**: No contact with the victim of this case
4. **Eligibility**: NOT eligible for Challenge Incarceration Program or Substance Abuse Program

### Count 2: Disorderly Conduct (Misdemeanor B with repeater)

**Incarceration:**
- **Initial Confinement**: 1 year
- **Extended Supervision**: 6 months
- **Total Bifurcated Sentence**: 1.5 years
- **Concurrent Provision**: "Concurrent with: Ct. 1"

**Conditions:**
1. **Financial**: $243.00 costs
2. **Incorporated Conditions**: "Same conditions as Ct. 1"

**Notable**: Dangerous weapon enhancer was **dismissed** on this count

### Comparative Analysis

| Element | Count 1 | Count 2 | Difference |
|---------|---------|---------|------------|
| Total Time | 15 years | 1.5 years | 10x longer |
| Relationship | Consecutive to other sentences | Concurrent with Ct. 1 | Count 1 adds real time |
| Costs | $518 | $243 | Higher for felony |
| DNA Required | Yes (explicit) | Yes (by reference) | Both require |
| No-Contact | Yes (explicit) | Yes (by reference) | Both require |
| Weapon Enhancer | Guilty | Dismissed | Only on felony |

### Effective Sentence

**Because Count 2 runs concurrent with Count 1, the effective sentence is:**
- **15 years total** (12 years confinement + 3 years extended supervision)
- **Consecutive** to any other sentence defendant was serving at the time
- **No jail credit** awarded (defendant was already incarcerated on other matters)
- **Total financial obligation**: $761 (paid in full per receivables data)

## 5. HABEAS CORPUS ACTIVITY ANALYSIS

### Complete Inventory of Writs

**Pre-Trial Phase (2016):**
1. Feb 16, 2016 - for 2/18/16 hearing
2. Feb 16, 2016 - for 2/25/16 hearing
3. Feb 24, 2016 - for March 3, 2016 hearing
4. March 14, 2016 - for 5/10/16 hearing
5. June 8, 2016 - for 7/20/16 hearing
6. July 22, 2016 - with petition for 8/4/16
7. Aug 10, 2016 - for Oct 24, 2016
8. Aug 17, 2016 - for 10/26/16 arraignment

**Pre-Trial Phase (2018-2019):**
9. Feb 22, 2018 - (petition filed)
10. Feb 22, 2018 - (proposed order)
11. Feb 23, 2018 - (writ issued)
12. Feb 23, 2018 - (second writ issued)
13. Dec 2, 2019 - for jury trial
14. Dec 17, 2019 - for 2/24/20 sentencing (petition)
15. Dec 18, 2019 - (writ issued)

**Sentencing Phase (2020):**
16. Feb 17, 2020 - for 2/24/20 sentencing
17. Feb 20, 2020 - (order issued)

**Post-Conviction Phase (2021):**
18. Aug 16, 2021 - for Green Bay Correctional (petition)
19. Aug 16, 2021 - for Wisconsin Secure Program Facility (petition)
20. Aug 17, 2021 - (writ issued for WSPF)
21. Aug 17, 2021 - (writ issued for GBCI)
22. Oct 27, 2021 - for GBCI 11/29/21 hearing
23. Nov 2, 2021 - (writ issued)

**TOTAL: 23 separate habeas corpus writs/petitions**

### Pattern Analysis & Implications

**Geographic Movement:**
- Waupun Correctional Institution (initial)
- Green Bay Correctional Institution (July 2016 - Nov 2022)
- Wisconsin Secure Program Facility (Nov 2022 - case end)

**What This Pattern Suggests:**

1. **Continuous Incarceration**: Defendant was serving another sentence throughout these proceedings (note: sentencing was "consecutive to any other sentence currently serving")

2. **Logistical Burden**: Each court appearance required formal writ to transport prisoner from correctional facility to Columbia County courthouse

3. **Extended Pre-Trial Detention**: The 23 writs across 5+ years demonstrate extraordinary delay while defendant remained incarcerated

4. **Video Conferencing Evolution**: Later proceedings (2019 onward) increasingly used video conferencing, but physical presence was still required for critical hearings

5. **Post-Conviction Complexity**: Multiple writs in 2021 for evidentiary hearings on speedy trial motion indicate ongoing litigation about the very delays that necessitated all these writs

**Irony**: The extensive habeas corpus record itself documents and evidences the speedy trial violation claim that ultimately resulted in reversal.

2018: ▮▮ (Continuance + speedy trial demand)
2019: ▮▮▮ (Motions in limine + Motion to Dismiss)

```

### Peak Motion Activity: 2021

**Reasons for 2021 spike:**
- Post-conviction motion filed (June 21)
- Evidentiary hearing required (Nov 29)
- Multiple extension requests (circuit court decision deadlines)
- Complex speedy trial violation claim requiring detailed record development
- Coordination between circuit court and Court of Appeals timelines

### Motion Success Rate

| Motion Type | Filed | Granted | Success Rate |
|------------|-------|---------|--------------|
| Continuances | ~5 | ~5 | 100% |
| Extension motions | 8 | 8 | 100% |
| Motion to Dismiss (2019) | 1 | 0 | 0% |
| Post-conviction motion (2021) | 1 | 0 | 0% |
| Supplemental PC motion (2022) | 1 | 0 | 0% |
| **Overall dispositive motions** | 3 | 0 | **0% at circuit court** |

**Critical Finding**: While procedural motions (continuances, extensions) were routinely granted, **all substantive motions were denied at the circuit court level**. However, the Court of Appeals ultimately vindicated the speedy trial claim, reversing the conviction.

## KEY TAKEAWAY

This case exemplifies how **speedy trial rights can prevail even after conviction**. Despite:
- A guilty verdict after 2-day jury trial
- Circuit court denying speedy trial motions twice
- A 15-year sentence imposed

The **constitutional violation of the defendant's speedy trial rights** ultimately resulted in complete reversal after 10+ years of litigation, demonstrating appellate courts' willingness to enforce constitutional protections even when it means vacating a jury conviction.

The 38-month pre-trial delay, compounded by the 15-month delay after the formal speedy trial demand, proved fatal to the prosecution's case—a powerful reminder that **justice delayed can be justice denied, even for the State**.
