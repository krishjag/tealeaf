## 1) Charge progression (chargeHistory vs. final charges)

### Original charges (from **chargeHistory**)
Both entries show **“Information Filed”** as the charging event, and there are **two charges**:
1. **Battery by Prisoners** — **Wis. Stat. § 940.20(1)** — **Felony H**
2. **Disorderly Conduct** — **Wis. Stat. § 947.01(1)** — **Misdemeanor B**

### Final charges (as disposed / judgmented)
The final charges match the original two charges—**no additional counts were added** and **no counts were dropped**. Both counts proceeded to **jury trial** and resulted in guilty verdicts, with one important modification to enhancers:

**Count 1 (Felony H): Battery by Prisoners, § 940.20(1)**
- **Disposition:** Found Guilty at Jury Trial
- **Enhancers/modifiers applied (and sustained):**
  - **Repeater** — **§ 939.62(1)(b)**
  - **Use of a Dangerous Weapon** — **§ 939.63(1)(b)**

**Count 2 (Misd. B): Disorderly Conduct, § 947.01(1)**
- **Disposition:** Found Guilty at Jury Trial
- **Enhancers/modifiers:**
  - **Repeater** — **§ 939.62(1)(a)** (applied)
  - **Dangerous weapon enhancer:** explicitly noted as **dismissed** at disposition (“With use of a dangerous weapon enhancer dismissed.”)

### Bottom line on charge changes
- **Counts:** stable (2 counts throughout).
- **Enhancers:** the key change is that **Count 2’s dangerous-weapon enhancer did not survive** (dismissed), while **Count 1’s dangerous-weapon enhancer did**.

## 3) Appellate docket entries (Court of Appeals + Supreme Court) and trajectory/outcome

### Court of Appeals-related entries (chronological)
- **2020-06-15** — Order of Court of Appeals (SPD appointment/transcript deadline extension context)
- **2020-10-27** — COA order extending time to file postconviction motion/notice of appeal
- **2020-12-23** — COA order extending time again
- **2021-02-22** — COA order extending time again
- **2021-04-21** — COA order extending time again
- **2021-10-19** — COA order extending time for circuit court to decide postconviction motion
- **2021-12-14** — COA order extending time to decide postconviction motion
- **2022-03-14** — COA order extending time to decide postconviction motion
- **2022-06-07** — Acknowledgment from Court of Appeals (notice of appeal received)
- **2022-07-11 / 2022-07-15** — Transmittal of record / acknowledgment events
- **2022-09-07** — Order of Court of Appeals (entry present but text not shown)
- **2022-09-30** — **COA order retaining jurisdiction and remanding** for supplemental postconviction motion (deadline structure set)
- **2023-01-10** — COA order extending circuit court deadline to decide supplemental motion (to May 22, 2023)
- **2023-02-07** — COA order (briefing/processing; filed by Clerk of COA)
- **2023-06-01** — COA order extending time to file appellant’s brief
- **2023-06-26** — COA order re transmittal timing + acknowledgment of supplemental record filed
- **2024-04-25** — **Court of Appeals decision & order reversing:**  
  “Reverse the Judgment of Conviction and Circuit Court Orders Denying Postconviction Motions and remand for the Circuit Court to Dismiss the Complaint.”

**COA outcome (as recorded here):** reversal and remand with direction to dismiss the complaint (i.e., a very strong defendant win at COA level).

### Supreme Court-related entries (chronological)
- **2024-05-28** — “Acknowledgment from Supreme Court” (petition for review stage)
- **2024-10-07** — Order of the Supreme Court (text not shown)
- **2024-11-11** — Supreme Court order setting petitioner-respondent opening brief due **12/06/2024**
- **2025-01-03** — Supreme Court order accepting defendant/appellant/respondent brief for filing
- **2025-06-27** — **Supreme Court decision filed** (“Review of Decision of the Court of Appeals/Supreme Court decision”)
- **2025-09-05** — **Remittitur** (petition for review case)

**Supreme Court outcome:** the docket indicates a decision was issued, but **the WCCA extract does not include the decision’s disposition text** (e.g., affirmed/reversed). What we *can* say from this dataset alone:
- COA reversed on 04/25/2024.
- Supreme Court granted/accepted review and issued a decision on 06/27/2025.
- Remittitur issued 09/05/2025 (case returned to lower court consistent with final appellate resolution).

## 4) Sentencing structure and supervision conditions (Ct. 1 vs Ct. 2)

### Count 1 (Battery by Prisoners, Felony H) — **consecutive**
- **Initial confinement (State Prison):** **12 years**
  - **Consecutive to:** “Any other sentence currently serving.”
- **Extended supervision:** **3 years**
  - **Consecutive to:** “Any other sentence currently serving.”
- **Conditions (listed under ES conditions):**
  - **Costs:** civil judgment language if unpaid at revocation/discharge
  - **Other:** **Submit DNA sample**; **No contact with the victim**

### Count 2 (Disorderly Conduct, Misd. B) — **concurrent with Ct. 1**
- **Initial confinement (State Prison):** **1 year**
  - **Concurrent with:** Ct. 1
- **Extended supervision:** **6 months**
  - **Concurrent with:** Ct. 1
- **Conditions:**
  - **Costs:** “Same conditions as Ct. 1.”

### Key differences
- **Consecutive vs concurrent:** Ct. 1 is consecutive to any other sentence; Ct. 2 is concurrent with Ct. 1.
- **Length:** Ct. 1 is the controlling sentence (12y IC + 3y ES). Ct. 2 is shorter (1y IC + 6m ES).
- **Conditions:** Ct. 2 incorporates Ct. 1’s conditions by reference; Ct. 1 explicitly lists **DNA submission** and **no-contact**.

(Also reflected in the sentencing hearing docket: Ct. 1 total 15 years bifurcated; Ct. 2 total 1.5 years bifurcated, concurrent.)

---

## 5) Habeas corpus activity (counts + interpretation)

### Count of “Writ of Habeas Corpus” docket entries
Counting entries explicitly labeled **“Writ of Habeas Corpus”** (not “Petition for writ…” or “Proposed Order”):
- **2016-02-16** (two writs)
- **2016-02-24** (one)
- **2016-03-14** (one)
- **2016-06-08** (one)
- **2016-07-22** (one)
- **2018-02-23** (two)
- **2019-12-02** (one)
- **2019-12-18** (one)
- **2021-08-17** (two)
- **2021-11-02** (one)

**Total “Writ of Habeas Corpus” entries: 15.**

If you include **“Petition for writ of habeas corpus”** entries as well, the total number of habeas-related filings is higher (multiple petitions appear on the same dates as writs, especially around hearings).

### What the pattern suggests (in this case context)
These are overwhelmingly **transport/production writs** to secure an incarcerated defendant’s presence (often via video) for hearings/trial/sentencing/postconviction proceedings—not habeas as a merits-based collateral attack. The clustering around key hearings (prelim, trial, sentencing, evidentiary hearings) supports that interpretation.

---

## 6) Motion practice patterns (types + when highest)

### Common motion types observed
- **Discovery-related demands** (Demand for discovery; Motion and demand for discovery)
- **Continuance / adjournment requests** (e.g., motion for continuance; letters requesting reset)
- **Motions in limine** (and additional motions in limine to exclude statements)
- **Motion to dismiss** (filed 2019-04-15; litigated 2019-06-17; denied)
- **Postconviction motions** (speedy trial violation; supplemental motion/motion to reconsider)
- **Appellate procedural motions** (multiple motions to extend deadlines—file postconviction motion/notice of appeal; extend time for circuit court decision; etc.)

### Phase with highest motion activity
Two peaks:
1. **Late pretrial → trial approach (2018–2019):** speedy trial demand (2018-09-26), in limine motions (2019-03-26), motion to dismiss (2019-04-15), continuances/resets.
2. **Postconviction/appeal management (2020–2023):** repeated **motions to extend time** and postconviction filings, including supplemental remand motion practice.

If counting sheer number of “Motion” docket lines, the **postconviction/appellate phase (2020–2023)** is especially dense due to repeated extension motions and remand-related filings.
