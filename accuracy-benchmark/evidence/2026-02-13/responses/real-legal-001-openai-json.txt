### 1) Time from offense date to sentencing date
- **Offense date:** 2015-05-05  
- **Sentencing date:** 2020-02-24  

Elapsed time = **4 years, 9 months** (approximately **57 months**).  
(Exact day count depends on method; by calendar difference it’s 4 years + 9 months + 19 days.)

### 4) Total docket entries per year (2016–2025) + most active year

Counted by the `date` field year for all listed docket entries:

- **2016:** 33  
- **2017:** 13  
- **2018:** 25  
- **2019:** 26  
- **2020:** 22  
- **2021:** 21  
- **2022:** 26  
- **2023:** 19  
- **2024:** 7  
- **2025:** 3  

**Most activity:** **2016** with **33** docket entries.

### 5) Appeal-related docket entries (Court of Appeals / Supreme Court) and percentage

I treated a docket entry as “appeal-related” if its description or text references:
- **Court of Appeals**, **Supreme Court**, **Notice of appeal**, **Order of Court of Appeals**, **Acknowledgment from Court of Appeals**, **Transmittal of record to court of appeals**, **Appeals Document Index**, **Remittitur**, etc.

**Appeal-related entries (count):** **33**

**Total docket entries (all years):**  
33 + 13 + 25 + 26 + 22 + 21 + 26 + 19 + 7 + 3 = **195**

**Percentage appeal-related:**  
33 / 195 = **16.9%** (about **17%**)

### 6) Receivables calculations (due, paid, balance, % collected)

Receivables show one item:
- **amountDue:** 761.00  
- **paid:** 352.00  
- **balanceDue:** 0.00 (but this appears inconsistent with amountDue/paid)  
- **adjust:** 0.00  

Using the financial arithmetic from the fields:
- **Total assessed/due:** **$761.00**
- **Total paid:** **$352.00**
- **Remaining (assessed minus paid):** **$409.00**
- **% collected:** 352 / 761 = **46.3%**

Note: the record also includes **probAmt = 409.00**, which matches the computed remaining amount. The `balanceDue: 0.0` field conflicts with the other numbers, so the most internally consistent “remaining” is **$409.00**.

### 7) Bond amount + bond-related docket entries and dates

**Bond amount set:** **$5,000 signature/recognizance bond** (“$5,000 recog. bond with felony conds.”)

Bond-related docket entries:

   - addlTxt: “with felony conds.”

2) **2016-02-11** — **“Hearing”** (narrative includes bond terms)  
   - addlTxt includes: “**$5,000 recog. bond with felony conds.**”

   - addlTxt: “and filed.”

4) **2016-10-26** — **“Arraignment”** (bond status)  
   - addlTxt includes: “**Bond continued.**”

If you want, I can also list the exact docket-entry indices/positions for these bond entries as they appear in your JSON.
