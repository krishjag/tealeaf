## 1) Balance sheet leverage (Debt, Equity, Debt/Equity)

**APPLE INC (FY ended 2025-09-30)**
- **Total debt** = Commercial paper **$7.979B** + Current term debt **$12.350B** + Noncurrent term debt **$78.328B** = **$98.657B**
- **Total stockholders’ equity** = **$73.733B**
- **Debt-to-equity** = 98.657 / 73.733 = **1.34x**

**VISA INC. (FY ended 2025-09-30)**
- **Total debt** = Current maturities of debt **$5.569B** + Long-term debt **$19.602B** = **$25.171B**
- **Total equity** (as reported) = **$37.909B**
- **Debt-to-equity** = 25.171 / 37.909 = **0.66x**

**COSTCO WHOLESALE CORP (FY ended 2025-08-31)**
- **Total debt** = (No short-term debt line provided on BS) + Long-term debt (noncurrent) **$5.713B** = **$5.713B**
- **Total stockholders’ equity** = **$29.164B**
- **Debt-to-equity** = 5.713 / 29.164 = **0.20x**

**QUALCOMM INC (FY ended 2025-09-30)**
- **Total debt** = Short-term debt **$0.000B** + Long-term debt **$14.811B** = **$14.811B**
- **Total stockholders’ equity** = **$21.206B**
- **Debt-to-equity** = 14.811 / 21.206 = **0.70x**

## 2) Cash flow profile (CFO / CFI / CFF) and Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow (FCF) defined as **Operating cash flow – Capital expenditures** (capex).

**APPLE**
- **CFO**: **$111.482B**
- **CFI**: **$15.195B**
- **CFF**: **-$120.686B**
- **Capex** (PP&E purchases): **$12.715B**
- **FCF** = 111.482 − 12.715 = **$98.767B**

**VISA**
- **CFO**: **$23.059B**
- **CFI**: **$0.708B**
- **CFF**: **-$18.963B**
- **Capex** (purchases of property, equipment & technology): **$1.482B**
- **FCF** = 23.059 − 1.482 = **$21.577B**

**COSTCO**
- **CFO**: **$13.335B**
- **CFI**: **-$5.311B**
- **CFF**: **-$3.775B**
- **Capex** (additions to property & equipment): **$5.498B**
- **FCF** = 13.335 − 5.498 = **$7.837B**

**QUALCOMM**
- **CFO**: **$14.012B**
- **CFI**: **-$0.800B**
- **CFF**: **-$13.196B**
- **Capex** (capital expenditures): **$1.192B**
- **FCF** = 14.012 − 1.192 = **$12.820B**

## 3) Interest expense and interest coverage (Operating income / Interest expense)

**APPLE**
- Operating income: **$133.050B**
- Interest expense: **Not provided in the supplied Income Statement items**
- **Interest coverage**: **N/M (insufficient data in extract)**

**VISA**
- Operating income: **$23.994B**
- Interest expense (nonoperating): **$0.589B**
- **Interest coverage** = 23.994 / 0.589 = **40.7x**

**COSTCO**
- Operating income: **$10.383B**
- Interest expense: **$0.154B**
- **Interest coverage** = 10.383 / 0.154 = **67.4x**

**QUALCOMM**
- Operating income: **$12.355B**
- Interest expense: **$0.664B**
- **Interest coverage** = 12.355 / 0.664 = **18.6x**

## 4) Summary questions

### 6. Strongest balance sheet (lowest leverage)
**Costco** has the **lowest debt-to-equity (0.20x)** → **strongest balance sheet / lowest leverage** among the four.

### 7. Most free cash flow
**Apple** generates the most FCF: **~$98.8B** (far above Visa ~$21.6B, Qualcomm ~$12.8B, Costco ~$7.8B).

### 8. Flags: concerning debt levels or negative free cash flow
- **Negative free cash flow:** **None** (all four are positive on CFO − capex).
- **Concerning debt levels (leverage):**
  - **Apple**: **Debt/Equity ~1.34x** (highest leverage in this set). Not necessarily distressed given very large CFO/FCF, but **balance-sheet leverage is meaningfully higher** than peers here.
  - **Visa / Qualcomm / Costco**: leverage appears **moderate-to-low** (0.66x / 0.70x / 0.20x respectively).

**Data limitation note:** Apple’s **interest expense** wasn’t included in the provided Income Statement tags, so its **interest coverage can’t be computed from this extract**.
