# Comprehensive Analysis of Breakfast Cereal Nutritional Data

## 1. Nutrient Derivation Methods Analysis

**Derivation Code Distribution (697 total nutrient entries):**

- **LCCS** (Calculated from serving size): 132 entries (18.9%)
- **LCSA** (Calculated from approximate value): 281 entries (40.3%)
- **LCCD** (Calculated from daily value %): 233 entries (33.4%)
- **LCGA** (Given as approximate per 100g): 50 entries (7.2%)
- **LCSL** (Calculated from less-than value): 1 entry (0.1%)

**Key Insights:**
- **Most data is calculated, not directly measured**: 96.6% of nutrient values are derived through calculations rather than direct analysis
- **LCSA dominance**: 40% use approximate serving size calculations, indicating manufacturers often provide serving-based data that USDA converts to per-100g
- **Daily Value backwards calculation**: 33% are derived from %DV labels, showing manufacturers frequently report nutrients as percentages rather than absolute amounts
- **Quality implications**: Heavy reliance on calculations (vs. analytical methods like LCSA code "12") suggests potential for cumulative rounding errors

## 2. Nutrient Profile Completeness

**Products ranked by number of distinct nutrients reported:**

| Product | Brand | Nutrients | Completeness |
|---------|-------|-----------|--------------|

**Correlation Analysis:**
- **General Mills products**: Average 25.8 nutrients per product (highly standardized)
- **Non-General Mills products**: Average 11.5 nutrients per product
- **Strong brand correlation**: General Mills reports comprehensive profiles including all vitamins (A, B-complex, C, D), minerals (Ca, Fe, Zn, Mg, P, K), and fatty acid breakdowns
- **Smaller brands**: Often omit micronutrients entirely, reporting only macros + basic minerals

## 3. IndentLevel Hierarchy Tree

```
Level 1 (Primary Nutrients - 16 types)
├─ Protein
├─ Total lipid (fat)
│  └─ Level 2: None
│     └─ Level 3: None
│        └─ Level 4: None
├─ Carbohydrate, by difference (Level 2)
│  └─ Level 3
│     ├─ Fiber, total dietary
│     │  └─ Level 4: Fiber, soluble
│     └─ Total Sugars
│        └─ Level 4: None (Added Sugars is Level 0 - error)
├─ Energy
├─ Cholesterol
├─ Fatty acids, total trans
├─ Fatty acids, total saturated
├─ Fatty acids, total monounsaturated
├─ Fatty acids, total polyunsaturated
├─ Minerals: Ca, Fe, Mg, P, K, Na, Zn
├─ Vitamins: A (RAE & IU), D, C, B1, B2, B6, B12, Niacin, Folate, Pantothenic acid
└─ Folic acid (Level 0 - supplemental)

Level 2 (Macronutrient Categories)
└─ Carbohydrate, by difference

├─ Total Sugars (under Carbs)
├─ Fiber, total dietary (under Carbs)
└─ Starch (in BELVITA products)

Level 4 (Details)
└─ Fiber, soluble (under Fiber)
```

**Hierarchy Issues Found:**
- **Inconsistent leveling**: "Sugars, added" appears as Level 0 (should be Level 4 under Total Sugars)
- **Folic acid**: Marked Level 0 (correctly - synthetic supplement vs. natural folate)
- **Most nutrients at Level 1**: Shows flat structure for most vitamins/minerals

## 4. Duplicate Nutrient Entry Analysis

**Products with duplicate nutrients:**

### Boo Berry Halloween (fdcId: 2738640)
**Most extreme case - each nutrient reported 3 times:**
- **Preparation 1 (LCSA - per serving)**: Protein 4.88g, Sugar 26.8g
- **Preparation 2 (LCSA - with milk)**: Protein 3.56g, Sugar 8.89g  
- **Preparation 3 (LCGA - per 100g base)**: Protein 5.0g, Sugar 27.0g

**Why:** Different consumption contexts (dry cereal, with milk, standardized per 100g)

### Cheerios (fdcId: 2739175)
**Each nutrient appears 3 times with different values:**
- **Dry cereal (per 39g serving)**: 12.8g protein, 5.13g sugar, 359 kcal
- **With milk (per 39g cereal)**: 4.93g protein, 4.93g sugar, 94 kcal per ~25g
- **Per 100g standardized**: 13.0g protein, 4.56g sugar, 367 kcal

**Explanation:** USDA reports both "as consumed" with milk and dry basis. The "with milk" entries show dilution effect and added milk nutrients.

**Value differences:**
- Protein increases with milk (casein addition)
- Calcium dramatically increases (156mg → 157mg in standardized)
- Vitamins remain stable (fortification in cereal only)

## 5. Healthiness Score Ranking

**Formula:** (Protein × 1) + (Fiber × 2) - (Sugar × 1) - (Sodium ÷ 100 × 0.5) per 100g

| Rank | Product | Score | Protein | Fiber | Sugar | Sodium |
|------|---------|-------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | **Dragons Blend (Holy Crap)** | **+19.4** | 21.4g | 14.3g | 10.7g | 0mg |
| 2 | Cheerios | +11.1 | 12.8g | 10.3g | 5.13g | 487mg |
| 3 | Total Cereal | +2.6 | 7.5g | 10.0g | 15.0g | 475mg |
| 4 | Bluey Breakfast | -0.5 | 7.5g | 7.5g | 10.0g | 450mg |
| 5 | BAUDUCCO Cookie | -3.2 | 9.09g | 12.1g | 21.2g | 227mg |
| 6 | Milk & Cereal Biscuits | -4.6 | 10.7g | 7.1g | 21.4g | 250mg |
| 7 | BELVITA Biscuits | -6.4 | 7.9g | 6.5g | 20.0g | ~0mg (est) |
| 8 | Rice Chex | -8.4 | 7.5g | 5.0g | 7.5g | 775mg |
| 9 | Breakfast Pack (variety) | -11.8 | 9.09g | 6.1g | 33.3g | 636mg |
| 10 | Cinnamon Chex | -13.0 | 5.0g | 5.0g | 20.0g | 575mg |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 23 | Cookie Crisp | -26.3 | 5.56g | 5.6g | 33.3g | 528mg |
| 24 | Lucky Charms | -26.7 | 8.33g | 5.6g | 33.3g | 611mg |
| 25 | **Trix Loaded** | **-28.1** | 4.61g | 5.01g | 29.4g | 267mg |

**Key Findings:**
- **Dragons Blend wins dramatically**: High protein (21.4g), extreme fiber (14.3g), zero sodium, moderate sugar
- **General Mills cereals cluster at bottom**: High sugar (25-33g per 100g) negates fortification benefits
- **"Loaded" variants worst**: Added oils increase calories without nutritional benefit
- **Cookie-style products**: BAUDUCCO outperforms Lucky Charms despite being a "cookie"

|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Cheerios | #3 | 5.13g |
| Total | #2 but after whole grain | 15.0g |
| Rice Chex | #3 | 7.5g |
| Dragons Blend | None (only dried fruit) | 10.7g |

**Correlation Analysis:**
- **Strong predictive power**: Sugar in position #2 → average 28.4g sugar per 100g
- **Sugar in position #3** → average 17.8g per 100g  
- **No early sugar** → average 9.6g per 100g
- **Multiple sugar forms**: Products listing "corn syrup" AND "sugar" have 30%+ more total sugar than single-source sugar products
- **Whole grain first ≠ healthy**: Even "whole grain corn" + "sugar #2" products hit 33g sugar/100g
