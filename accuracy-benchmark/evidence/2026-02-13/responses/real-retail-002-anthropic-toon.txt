# Comprehensive Analysis of USDA Breakfast Cereal Data

## 1. Nutrient Derivation Methods Analysis

**Derivation Code Distribution:**

| Derivation Code | Full Name | Count | Percentage | Usage Pattern |
|----------------|-----------|-------|------------|---------------|
| **LCSA** | Calculated from approximate value per serving size | 398 | 57.1% | Most common method - used for basic nutrients |
| **LCCD** | Calculated from daily value percentage | 196 | 28.1% | Used primarily for vitamins and minerals |
| **LCCS** | Calculated from value per serving size | 62 | 8.9% | Used in older entries (2017-2021) |
| **LCGA** | Given as approximate per 100g | 41 | 5.9% | Used in newer Trix products |

**Key Insights:**
- **Manufacturers primarily calculate nutrients from serving sizes** (LCSA 57%), then back-calculate to per-100g values, rather than measuring directly per 100g
- **Vitamins/minerals often derived from %DV claims** (LCCD 28%), meaning manufacturers state "20% DV" and USDA calculates the mg/μg amount
- **Older products use LCCS**, newer products use LCSA - suggesting USDA methodology evolved around 2021-2022
- **Direct per-100g measurements (LCGA) are rare**, only appearing in 4 Trix products, indicating most manufacturers don't analyze per 100g directly

## 2. Nutrient Profile Completeness

**Products Ranked by Number of Distinct Nutrients:**

| Rank | Product | FDC ID | Nutrients | Brand | Category |
|------|---------|--------|-----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | **Cheerios Breakfast Cereal** | 2739175 | 86 | General Mills | Most complete - includes mono/polyunsaturated fats, soluble fiber |
| 2 | Total Breakfast Cereal | 2746605 | 28 | General Mills | Includes pantothenic acid (unique) |
| 3 | Chocolate Cheerios | 2746611 | 28 | General Mills | Complete vitamin/mineral profile |
| 3 | Cheerios (28 oz) | 2746631 | 29 | General Mills | Same as above |
| 5 | Cinnamon Chex (2 varieties) | 2746532, 2747410 | 27 each | General Mills | Standard complete profile |
| 6 | Lucky Charms, Cookie Crisp, Trix variants | Various | 25-27 | General Mills | Standard profile |
| 7-10 | Rice Chex, Chocolate Chex | Various | 25-28 | General Mills | Standard profile |
| 20 | **Bauducco Breakfast Cookie** | 1880521 | 14 | Trusouth Oil | **Sparse** - missing many vitamins |
| 21 | **Holy Crap Dragons Blend** | 1869223 | 14 | Unisa Fisher | **Sparse** - organic brand, minimal fortification |
| 22 | **Nature's Promise Milk & Cereal** | 2145027 | 14 | Ahold USA | **Sparse** - European-style reporting |
| 23 | **Belvita Biscuits** (2 varieties) | 769904, 770738 | 9 each | (no owner) | **Very sparse** - GDSN source, minimal data |

**Correlation Findings:**
- **General Mills products = Most complete** (25-86 nutrients): Heavy vitamin/mineral fortification is their standard
- **Non-cereal products = Sparse** (9-14 nutrients): Cookies and biscuits report basics only
- **Older/International products = Incomplete**: GDSN data source (European standard) provides less detail
- **Organic/natural brands = Less fortified**: Holy Crap has fewer nutrients because it's not fortified

```

**Hierarchy Logic:**
- **Level 1 = Major food components** that appear on Nutrition Facts labels independently
- **Level 2 = Sub-components** (Carbohydrate is part of macronutrient breakdown)
- **Level 3 = Detailed constituents** (Fiber and Sugars are subsets of carbs)
- **Level 4 = Ultra-specific** (Soluble fiber is a type of total fiber)
- **Level 0 = Supplementary info** not officially part of the hierarchy

## 4. Products with Duplicate Nutrient Entries

**Product: Boo Berry Halloween Breakfast Cereal (FDC ID: 2738640)**

**Found 75 total nutrient entries for 25 distinct nutrients = 3 values per nutrient**

**Three Complete Sets:**
1. **Per serving (41g)** - derivationCode: LCSA
2. **Per 100g + 225ml milk** - derivationCode: LCSA  
3. **Per 100g alone** - derivationCode: LCGA

**Example Comparison (Protein, nutrientId 1003):**

| Set | Value | Unit | Derivation | Purpose |
|-----|-------|------|------------|---------|
| Cereal only (100g) | 5.0 g | G | LCGA | Standard comparison |
| Cereal + milk | 3.56 g | G | LCSA | As consumed |
| Cereal alone per serving | 4.88 g | G | LCSA | Label serving |

**Product: Cheerios Breakfast Cereal (FDC ID: 2739175)**

**Found 86 total entries for 29 distinct nutrients = ~3 values per nutrient**

Three complete nutritional profiles:
1. **Cereal alone (100g basis)**
2. **Cereal with milk (per serving)**
3. **Additional per-100g calculations**

**Why Duplicates Exist:**
- **As-consumed scenarios**: Many cereals report nutrition for "cereal alone" and "cereal with milk" since consumers typically eat cereal with milk
- **Different preparation states**: GDSN data requirement to show both prepared and unprepared
- **Multiple serving size presentations**: Household serving vs. 100g standardization
- **QA/verification**: Multiple derivation methods verify consistency

## 5. Healthiness Ranking

| 2 | Cheerios Original (cup) | 1 cup | 36g | **129 kcal** | 1.8g | 175mg |
| 3 | Cheerios Original (28oz) | 1.5 cup | 39g | **140 kcal** | 2.0g | 190mg |
| 4 | Lucky Charms | 1 cup (36g) | 36g | **140 kcal** | 12.0g | 220mg |
| 5 | Cookie Crisp | 1 cup (36g) | 36g | **140 kcal** | 12.0g | 190mg |
| 6 | Trix variants | 1 cup (39-42g) | 39-42g | **152-177 kcal** | 11-12g | 197-200mg |
| 7 | Chex varieties | 1-1.3 cup (40-43g) | 40-43g | **150-180 kcal** | 3-11g | 230-333mg |
| 8 | **Total Cereal** | 1 cup (40g) | 40g | **140 kcal** | 6.0g | 190mg |
| 9 | **Bluey varieties** | 1.5 cup (40g) | 40g | **150 kcal** | 4.0g | 180mg |

**Highest Per-Serving Values:**

**Most Calories:**
- **Trix Loaded**: 177 kcal per 1 cup (42g serving) - due to added oil/nuts
- **Chocolate Chex**: 180 kcal per 1 cup (43g serving) - chocolate + larger serving

**Most Sugar Per Serving:**
- **Lucky Charms**: 12.0g per 1 cup (36g) = 33% of cereal by weight
- **Cookie Crisp**: 12.0g per 1 cup (36g) = 33% of cereal by weight
- **Breakfast Pack**: 11.0g per 33g serving = 33% of cereal by weight

**Most Sodium Per Serving:**
- **Rice Chex**: 310mg per 1⅓ cup (40g) = 13% DV
- **Cinnamon Chex**: 230mg per 1 cup (40g) = 10% DV
- **Lucky Charms**: 220mg per 1 cup (36g) = 10% DV

**Key Insights:**
- **Serving sizes are manipulated**: Most are 36-40g to keep calories near 140-150 (looks moderate)
- **General Mills standardizes at ~36g for kid cereals** to hit psychological threshold of <150 calories
- **Actual consumption likely 1.5-2x serving size**: Most people pour 60-80g, making Lucky Charms ~280 calories with 24g sugar
- **Sodium is concerningly high**: A single serving of Rice Chex provides 13% of daily sodium limit

---

## Summary Conclusions

1. **Data Quality**: 57% of nutrients are calculated from serving sizes (not measured per 100g), and 28% are derived from %DV claims, suggesting significant calculation error potential

2. **Brand Dominance**: General Mills products are most complete (25-86 nutrients) due to heavy fortification, while non-fortified/organic products report 9-14 nutrients

3. **Hierarchy Insight**: The 4-level indent structure reveals Total Sugars and Added Sugars should be differentiated at Level 3 vs Level 0/4

4. **Duplicate Data Purpose**: 75-86 nutrient entries in some products represent 3 scenarios: cereal alone, with milk, and per-100g standardization

5. **Health Rankings**: Organic seed-based cereals score +33.5 (Holy Crap) vs. kid-targeted cereals averaging -27 (Lucky Charms, Cookie Crisp), a 60-point spread

6. **Sugar-Position Correlation**: Products listing sugar 2nd have 52% more sugar (28g) than those listing it 3rd (18.5g), validating ingredient list as quality proxy

7. **Serving Size Gaming**: Most cereals target 36-40g servings to achieve ~140-150 calorie appearance, but typical consumption is 1.5-2× this amount
