## 4) Disability: average DISABLT prevalence per county + highest burden
Definition: average of the 7 disability measures (**COGNITION, DISABILITY, HEARING, INDEPLIVE, MOBILITY, SELFCARE, VISION**).

| County | Avg disability prevalence |
|---|---:|
| King | 7.77 |
| Pierce | 11.89 |
| Spokane | 11.19 |
| Clark | 10.56 |
| Yakima | 13.84 |
| Whatcom | 11.01 |
| Benton | 11.13 |
| Island | 10.76 |
| Ferry | 15.40 |
| Garfield | 11.71 |

Highest disability burden (by this average): **Ferry (15.40%)**.

---

## 5) Preventive service utilization leaders (PREVENT)
Highest rates among the 10 counties:

- **Dental visit (DENTAL): King — 71.8%**
- **Mammography (MAMMOUSE): Spokane — 76.9%**
- **Cholesterol screening (CHOLSCREEN): Garfield — 86.4%**

---

## 6) Population-weighted average obesity (OBESITY), weighted by adult_population
Weighted mean = \(\sum (adult\_pop_i \times obesity_i) / \sum adult\_pop_i\)

- Total adult population (10 counties): **4,004,711**
- **Population-weighted obesity prevalence: 28.0%** (approx. **28.03%**)

(Heavily influenced by King due to its large adult population and lower obesity prevalence.)

## 7) For each category, measure with highest overall average prevalence (across counties)
Computed as the simple average of the measure’s prevalence across the 10 counties provided.

- **HLTHOUT (Health Outcomes): HIGHCHOL (High cholesterol) — avg ~35.84%**
- **HLTHSTAT (Health Status): GHLTH (Fair/poor self-rated health) — avg ~18.30%**
- **PREVENT (Prevention): CHOLSCREEN (Cholesterol screening) — avg ~83.77%**
- **RISKBEH (Risk Behaviors): SLEEP (Short sleep duration) — avg ~31.51%**
- **DISABLT (Disability): DISABILITY (Any disability) — avg ~29.90%**

Note: The dataset excerpt you provided includes **no HRSN measures**, so I cannot compute the “highest overall average prevalence” for **HRSN** from the supplied county records. If you share the HRSN fields (or the full 33-measure extract for these counties), I can add that category as well.
