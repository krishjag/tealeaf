## 4. Structural Comparison: Leisure & Hospitality vs. Professional Services

| Metric | Leisure & Hospitality | Prof & Business Services | Difference |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| **JO Rate** | 5.73% | 5.39% | +0.34pp |
| **Hire Rate** | 5.72% | 4.54% | +1.18pp |
| **Separation Rate** | 5.53% | 4.57% | +0.96pp |
| **Quit Rate** | 3.99% | 2.34% | +1.65pp |
| **Layoff Rate** | 1.43% | 1.99% | -0.56pp |
| **Other Sep Rate** | 0.13% | 0.23% | -0.10pp |

### **Structural Differences:**

**Leisure & Hospitality:**
- **Ultra-high churn**: 5.7% monthly hiring/separation (68% annual turnover)
- **Quit-driven separations**: 72% of separations are quits (3.99%/5.53%)
- **Worker agency**: Employees leave voluntarily at 2.8x the quit rate of professional services
- **Fewer layoffs**: Only 26% of separations vs 44% in prof services
- **Near-equilibrium**: Hiring barely exceeds separations (+0.19% growth)

**Professional & Business Services:**
- **Moderate churn**: 4.5% rates despite high absolute volumes
- **Layoff-driven dynamics**: Higher layoff rate (1.99%) reflects restructuring/project cycles
- **Lower voluntary mobility**: Workers less likely to quit (41% of separations)
- **Slight contraction**: Separations slightly exceed hires (-0.03%)
- **More "other" separations**: Higher retirement/transfer rate

**Conclusion**: Hospitality runs a "revolving door" model with low attachment and worker-initiated exits, while professional services shows stickier employment with more employer-driven separations through layoffs and restructuring.

## 5. Construction Seasonality

**Monthly Hires Levels (thousands):**
- **Highest**: April (364)
- **Lowest**: March (306)
- **Range**: 58 thousand

**Seasonal Pattern**: Peak hiring in April (spring construction season start) with a surprising March dip. The data shows construction ramping up for summer building season, with consistent 330-360K monthly hiring through summer/fall before year-end.

## 6. Separation Composition by Industry

**Annual totals by type (% of total separations):**

| Industry | Quits | Layoffs | Other | Quit Share Rank | Layoff Share Rank |
|----------|-------|---------|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Total nonfarm** | 60.9% | 33.5% | 5.6% | - | - |
| Total private | 62.9% | 32.5% | 4.6% | - | - |
| **Construction** | 41.8% | 54.1% | 4.1% | 10 | **1 (Highest)** |
| Manufacturing | 59.1% | 36.6% | 4.3% | 8 | 3 |
| **Retail trade** | 66.9% | 30.6% | 2.5% | **2 (High)** | 7 |
| Information | 47.9% | 46.7% | 5.4% | 11 | 2 |
| Financial activities | 57.4% | 35.9% | 6.8% | 9 | 4 |
| Prof & business services | 52.0% | 44.9% | 3.2% | 12 | 3 |
| **Health care** | 73.9% | 23.1% | 3.0% | **1 (Highest)** | 11 |
| **Leisure & hospitality** | 72.1% | 25.8% | 2.1% | **3 (High)** | 10 |
| Accommodation & food | 74.6% | 23.4% | 2.0% | **(Highest sub-sector)** | 12 |
| Government | 52.6% | 30.9% | 16.5% | - | - |

### **Key Findings:**

**Highest Quit Share:**
1. **Accommodation & food services**: 74.6%
2. **Health care and social assistance**: 73.9%
3. **Leisure and hospitality**: 72.1%

These are worker-driven markets where employees vote with their feet, reflecting job dissatisfaction, better opportunities, or transient workforce nature.

**Highest Layoff Share:**
1. **Construction**: 54.1%
2. **Information**: 46.7%
3. **Professional & business services**: 44.9%

Construction's layoff dominance reflects project-based work cycles. Information's high layoff rate confirms tech sector workforce reductions in 2025.

**Government anomaly**: 16.5% "other separations" (retirements) - 3x the overall average, reflecting an aging public sector workforce.

## 7. Labor Market Tightness (Job Openings to Unemployment Ratio)

### **Total Nonfarm Analysis:**

**Average Monthly Job Openings**: 7,243 thousand

To calculate the implied ratio, we need to reference unemployment data. While not provided in this dataset, we can assess **relative tightness** through the JO rate trajectory:

- **Q1 2025**: 4.5% average (looser)
- **Q2 2025**: 4.5% average (stable)
- **Q3 2025**: 4.4% average (looser)
- **Q4 2025**: 4.2% average (loosening trend)

**December 2025**: 6,542 thousand openings at 3.9% rate

### **Tightness Assessment:**

The declining JO rate from 4.7% (January) to 3.9% (December) represents a **17% decrease**, indicating:

1. **Loosening labor market**: Employers posting fewer vacancies
2. **Better balance**: Moving toward pre-pandemic equilibrium (typical pre-2020 JO rate was 3.5-4.0%)
3. **Employer leverage increasing**: Workers have fewer outside options
4. **Wage pressure declining**: Reduced competition for talent

**Historical context**: The 2025 average of 4.4% remains elevated versus the 2010-2019 average of 3.7%, suggesting the market is still moderately tight but normalizing from the extreme post-pandemic tightness of 2021-2022 (when JO rates exceeded 7%).

**Implied ratio direction**: If unemployment remained stable around 3.5-4.0% (typical recent range), the openings-to-unemployed ratio would be declining from roughly 1.2:1 to 1.0:1, approaching balance where each unemployed person has roughly one suitable opening.

2. **Quit rates signal confidence**: 72-75% quit shares in service sectors show workers still have options
3. **Construction volatility**: Highest layoff dependency due to project cycles
4. **Gradual cooling**: 2025 shows steady normalization toward pre-pandemic labor market conditions
5. **Structural churn**: Professional services and hospitality drive >1M monthly job changes each
