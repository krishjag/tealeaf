I can’t complete the full “all 25 products” calculations from what you pasted because the `foods:@table` content is truncated in this message (I can only see a subset of the 25 items, and several of those have duplicated nutrient blocks within the same food). If you paste/provide the full JSON for all 25 foods (or upload the file), I can compute everything exactly as requested.

That said, I *can* compute the requested metrics for the products that are fully visible and have a clean per-100g macro set in the snippet. Below are results for the clearly readable items (and I flag data-quality issues where they affect calculations).

## 1) Nutrition summary table (per 100 g) — from visible products

**Columns:** kcal, protein g, fat g, carbs g, sugars g, fiber g (all per 100 g)

| fdcId | Product (short) | Brand owner | kcal | Protein (g) | Fat (g) | Carbs (g) | Sugars (g) | Fiber (g) |
|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

| 2746605 | Total Breakfast Cereal | GENERAL MILLS SALES INC. | 350 | 7.5 | 2.5 | 82.5 | 15.0 | 10.0 |

| 2747410 | Cinnamon Chex (another GTIN) | GENERAL MILLS SALES INC. | 400 | 5.0 | 8.75 | 82.5 | 20.0 | 5.0 |
| 2746533 | Chocolate Chex | GENERAL MILLS SALES INC. | 419 | 4.65 | 8.14 | 81.4 | 25.6 | 4.7 |
| 2746611 | Chocolate Cheerios | GENERAL MILLS SALES INC. | 389 | 8.33 | 5.56 | 80.6 | 27.8 | 8.3 |

| 2738994 | Cheerios Cup | GENERAL MILLS SALES INC. | 361 | 13.9 | 6.94 | 75.0 | 5.56 | 11.1 |

**Notes / data issues**
- The BelVita entries shown include starch and sugars and fiber, but **do not show “Carbohydrate, by difference”** in the visible nutrient list, so carbs can’t be filled from this snippet.
- Some foods in the snippet (notably **Boo Berry** and **Cheerios**) contain **multiple repeated macro blocks** (likely per-serving + with-milk + per-100g). For the Cheerios items above, I used the first consistent per-100g block shown for those specific fdcIds.

---

## 2) Sugar-to-fiber ratio (sugars ÷ fiber)

Computed for items above where both sugars and fiber are present:

| Product | Sugars (g) | Fiber (g) | Sugar:Fiber |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Cheerios Cup | 5.56 | 11.1 | **0.50** |
| Cheerios (359 kcal/100g entries) | 5.13 | 10.3 | **0.50** |
| Rice Chex | 7.5 | 5.0 | 1.50 |
| Bluey (all sizes) | 10.0 | 7.5 | 1.33 |
| Total | 15.0 | 10.0 | 1.50 |
| Holy Crap Dragons Blend | 10.7 | 14.3 | 0.75 |
| Bauducco Breakfast Cookie | 21.2 | 12.1 | 1.75 |
| Nature’s Promise biscuits | 21.4 | 7.1 | 3.01 |
| Cinnamon Chex | 20.0 | 5.0 | 4.00 |
| Chocolate Chex | 25.6 | 4.7 | 5.45 |
| Chocolate Cheerios | 27.8 | 8.3 | 3.35 |
| Cookie Crisp | 33.3 | 5.6 | 5.95 |
| Lucky Charms | 33.3 | 5.6 | 5.95 |
| “Breakfast Pack Cereal” | 33.3 | 6.1 | 5.46 |

**Best (lowest) ratio (from visible products):**
- **Cheerios (including Cup)** at ~**0.50**

**Worst (highest) ratio (from visible products):**
- **Cookie Crisp** and **Lucky Charms** tie at ~**5.95**

(Once you provide the full 25-food dataset, I’ll confirm whether any other product beats these extremes.)

---

## 3) Rank by protein per 100 g (highest → lowest) + range

From the visible products:

1. **Holy Crap Dragons Blend** — 21.4 g  
2. **Cheerios Cup** — 13.9 g  
3. **Cheerios** — 12.8 g (two entries shown)  
4. **Nature’s Promise biscuits** — 10.7 g  
5. **Bauducco cookie** — 9.09 g  
6. **Breakfast Pack Cereal** — 9.09 g  
7. **Chocolate Cheerios** — 8.33 g  
8. **Lucky Charms** — 8.33 g  
9. **Bluey** — 7.5 g (all sizes)  
10. **Rice Chex** — 7.5 g  
11. **Total** — 7.5 g  
12. **BelVita** — 7.9 g (would slot between 8.33 and 7.5 if included; carbs missing but protein ok)  
13. **Cookie Crisp** — 5.56 g  
14. **Cinnamon Chex** — 5.0 g (two entries)  
15. **Chocolate Chex** — 4.65 g  

**Protein range (max − min) from visible products:**
- Max 21.4 − Min 4.65 = **16.75 g per 100 g**

---

## 4) Micronutrients: iron (Fe) and calcium (Ca) — most fortified / highest

From visible products (per 100 g):

- **Highest iron:**  
  - **Total Breakfast Cereal** — **45 mg Fe/100 g** (very high fortification)
  - Next highest visible: Rice Chex 36 mg, Cheerios ~32.3 mg

- **Highest calcium:**  
  - **Chocolate Cheerios** and **Cookie Crisp** and **Lucky Charms** show **361 mg Ca/100 g** (tie among visible items)
  - Cheerios shows 333 mg; Bluey 325 mg; Chex often 325 mg

(Again, full dataset may include higher Ca products.)

---

## 5) Average sodium + products >500 mg and <200 mg sodium (per 100 g)

Using the visible products with sodium present (mg/100 g):

Values used:
- Bauducco 227
- Breakfast Pack 636
- Bluey (3 items) 450, 450, 450
- Cheerios 487, 487
- Cheerios Cup 500
- Chocolate Cheerios 500
- Chocolate Chex 581
- Cinnamon Chex 575, 575
- Cookie Crisp 528
- Dragons Blend 0
- Lucky Charms 611
- Nature’s Promise biscuits 250
- Rice Chex 775
- Total 475

Count = 19 items (note: duplicates by package size are included because they are separate products in FDC).

**Average sodium (visible set):**
- Sum 9107 mg / 19 = **~479 mg sodium per 100 g**

**Exceed 500 mg/100 g (visible set):**
- Rice Chex (775)
- Breakfast Pack Cereal (636)
- Lucky Charms (611)
- Chocolate Chex (581)
- Cinnamon Chex (575) — both entries
- Cookie Crisp (528)

**Below 200 mg/100 g (visible set):**
- Holy Crap Dragons Blend (0 mg)

(Closest low but not <200: Bauducco 227; Nature’s Promise 250.)

---

## 6) Brand-owner comparison: General Mills vs non–General Mills (visible subset)

I grouped as:
- **General Mills** = brandOwner contains “GENERAL MILLS” (including “GENERAL MILLS SALES INC.”)
- **Non-General Mills** = Trusouth, Unisa Fisher, Ahold, and the blank-owner BelVita entries (but BelVita lacks calories/carbs in snippet; I excluded BelVita from averages to avoid partial macros)

### General Mills averages (visible GM items; n=15)
Calories (kcal/100g): **~381.6**  
Sugars (g/100g): **~18.9**  
Fiber (g/100g): **~7.0**  
Protein (g/100g): **~7.9**

### Non–General Mills averages (visible non-GM items with complete macros; n=4)
(Bauducco, Holy Crap, Nature’s Promise biscuits; BelVita excluded due to missing calories/carbs in snippet)
Calories: **~450.7**  
Sugars: **~17.8**  
Fiber: **~11.2**  
Protein: **~13.7**

Interpretation (for this partial set): non-GM items skew higher in protein/fiber largely because **Holy Crap Dragons Blend** is seed-based and very nutrient-dense.

---

## 7) Vitamin D percentDailyValue: count, range, highest

From the visible products, **Vitamin D %DV is present** for many General Mills cereals and for Nature’s Promise (as 0%).

Examples seen:
- Breakfast Pack: Vitamin D 8% DV
- Bluey: 20% DV
- Boo Berry: 20% DV (but that record is messy/duplicated)
- Cheerios: 20% DV
- Cheerios Cup: 15% DV
- Chocolate Cheerios: 20% DV
- Chex (Rice/Cinnamon/Chocolate): 20% DV
- Lucky Charms: 20% DV
- Total: 20% DV
- Nature’s Promise biscuits: 0% DV (Vitamin D IU entry)

**Count (visible products only):** at least **14** distinct products show a Vitamin D %DV entry in the snippet (exact count for all 25 requires full dataset).

**Range of Vitamin D %DV (visible):** **0% to 20%**

**Highest Vitamin D %DV (visible):** **20%** (multiple products tie: Bluey, Cheerios, Chex, Lucky Charms, Total, etc.)

# What I need to finish this for all 25 products (exactly as requested)
Please provide either:
1) the full `foods` JSON array for all 25 items (preferred), or  
2) a file upload / paste in multiple chunks.

Once I have the complete dataset, I will:
- generate the **full 25-row nutrition summary table**
- compute **sugar:fiber for all 25** and identify best/worst
- rank **all 25 by protein** and compute the true range
- find true maxima for **iron and calcium**
- compute **average sodium across all 25** and list >500 and <200 mg/100g
- compute **General Mills vs non-GM averages** using all products
- count **Vitamin D %DV presence across all 25**, compute range, and identify the top product(s)
