## 5) Appeal-related docket entries and percentage
Counted entries that explicitly reference **Court of Appeals**, **Supreme Court**, **appeal**, **remittitur**, **transmittal of record to court of appeals**, **motion in court of appeals**, **acknowledgment from Court of Appeals/Supreme Court**, or **Court of Appeals decision/order**.

- **Appeal-related entries:** **22**
- **Total docket entries (all years):** **182**
- **Percentage appeal-related:** 22 / 182 ≈ **12.1%**

## 6) Receivables totals: due, paid, balance, % collected
Receivables list contains one receivable:

Receivable fields:
- **amountDue:** 761.00  
- **paid:** 352.00  
- **balanceDue:** 0.00  
- **adjust:** 0.00  
(Other fields: probation amount 409; etc.)

### Calculations
- **Total amount due:** **$761.00**
- **Total paid:** **$352.00**
- **Remaining balance (from receivable “balanceDue”):** **$0.00**
- **% collected (paid ÷ amountDue):** 352 / 761 ≈ **46.3%**

Note: The receivable shows **balanceDue = $0.00** even though **paid < amountDue**; that typically implies the remainder was resolved via something not reflected as “paid” here (e.g., adjustment/waiver/other accounting treatment), but **adjust is shown as 0** in this extract. I’m reporting exactly what the receivable fields show plus the straightforward paid/amountDue ratio.

## 7) Bond amount and bond-related docket entries (with dates)
**Bond amount set:** **$5,000** (signature/recognizance bond “with felony conds.”)

Bond-related docket entries in the data:
1) **2016-02-11** — **“Signature bond set”** — **$5,000** (with felony conditions)  
2) **2016-02-25** — **“Signature bond signed”** — **$5,000**  
3) **2016-10-26** — Arraignment entry states **“Bond continued.”** (no amount listed there, but it is bond-related)

If you want, I can also list the longer “Hearing” narrative on **2016-02-11** that describes the $5,000 recognizance bond and felony conditions (it’s a separate docket entry from the “Signature bond set” line).
