| **Block 1308** | 601 Lexington | **Not calculable** | 70,572 sf | - |
| **Block 1265** | 1250 Ave Americas | **65.8%** | 107,766 sf | 70,875 sf |

**Lowest Lot Coverage** (most open space):

| Property | Address | Coverage | Lot Area | Open Space |
|----------|---------|----------|----------|------------|
| **Block 1130** | Natural History Museum | **16.3%** | 738,000 sf | 618k sf open |
| **Block 1373** | Roosevelt Island | **0%** | 4.23M sf | No bldg dimensions |

### Patterns:
- **Midtown office towers**: 50-80% coverage (maximize FAR)
- **Campus-style developments** (hospitals, museums, housing): <30% coverage
- **Slender luxury towers**: High coverage ratio on small lots
- **Note**: Many properties show 0 for bldgfront/bldgdepth, making calculation impossible

**Best example of efficient land use**: **1250 Avenue of the Americas** - 66% coverage, 70-story tower on Rockefeller Center site
