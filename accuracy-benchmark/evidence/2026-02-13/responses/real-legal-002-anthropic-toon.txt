# Criminal Justice Analysis: Wisconsin v. Ramirez (2016CF000031)

## 1. CHARGE PROGRESSION ANALYSIS

**Original Charges (chargeHistory):**
- Count 1: Battery by Prisoners, §940.20(1), Felony H
- Count 2: Disorderly Conduct, §947.01(1), Misdemeanor B

**Final Charges - NO CHARGES ADDED OR DROPPED:**
Both original charges proceeded to trial and conviction.

**Charge Modifiers Applied:**

*Count 1 - Battery by Prisoners:*
- **§939.62(1)(b) - Repeater Enhancement** (increases maximum penalty)
- **§939.63(1)(b) - Use of a Dangerous Weapon Enhancement** (adds 5 years to maximum)
- Both enhancers RETAINED at sentencing

*Count 2 - Disorderly Conduct:*
- **§939.62(1)(a) - Repeater Enhancement** (misdemeanor level)
- Disposition notes: "**With use of a dangerous weapon enhancer dismissed**"
- The weapon enhancer was originally charged but dismissed at sentencing

**Significance:** The prosecution pursued aggressive enhancement charges. The dangerous weapon (a pencil, per trial exhibit) was deemed applicable to the felony but not the misdemeanor at sentencing.

## 3. APPELLATE TRAJECTORY - CHRONOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

### **Court of Appeals Proceedings (2022AP000959):**

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 6/2/2022 | Notice of appeal filed | Defendant appeals conviction |
| 6/7/2022 | COA acknowledges receipt | Appeal docketed |
| 7/11/2022 | Record transmitted | Circuit court record sent |
| 7/15/2022 | Transcript filed (5/13/22 oral ruling) | Post-conviction hearing transcript |
| 7/26/2022 | Trial transcripts filed | Both days of trial |
| **9/7/2022** | **COA Order - Retains jurisdiction** | **Court keeps case active** |
| **9/30/2022** | **COA Remand Order** | **Remanded for supplemental post-conviction motion** |
| 1/10/2023 | Extension order | Time extended to 5/22/23 |
| 1/26/2023 | Supplemental record transmitted | Post-remand proceedings |

| **4/25/2024** | **COA REVERSAL DECISION** | **"Reverse the Judgment of Conviction and Circuit Court Orders Denying Postconviction Motions and remand for the Circuit Court to Dismiss the Complaint"** |

### **Wisconsin Supreme Court Proceedings:**

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 5/28/2024 | Acknowledgment of petition for review | State petitions Supreme Court |
| 6/6/2024 | Status conference held | Circuit court monitors |
| 10/7/2024 | Supreme Court order | (Likely granting review) |
| 11/11/2024 | Briefing order | Plaintiff's brief due 12/6/24 |
| 1/3/2025 | Order | Defendant's brief accepted |

| 9/5/2025 | Remittitur issued | Final mandate to circuit court |
| 10/2/2025 | Notice of completion | Attorney Lohr files completion |

### **Appellate Outcome:**

The **Court of Appeals REVERSED the conviction** and ordered the case dismissed. The State then sought Supreme Court review. The Supreme Court issued its decision on **June 27, 2025** - the document doesn't explicitly state whether the Supreme Court affirmed the reversal or reversed the Court of Appeals, but the **remittitur was issued** and **Attorney Lohr filed a "Notice of Completion"** on October 2, 2025, suggesting the appellate process concluded in the defendant's favor.

**The core issue:** Speedy trial violation - the same ground the defendant raised unsuccessfully at the trial level became the basis for appellate reversal.

## 5. HABEAS CORPUS ACTIVITY ANALYSIS

### **Complete Writ Inventory:**

**2016 (8 writs):**
1. February 16 - for 2/18/16 hearing (Waupun CI)
2. February 16 - for 2/25/16 preliminary hearing
3. February 24 - for 3/3/16 hearing
4. March 14 - for 5/10/16 return date
5. June 8 - for 7/20/16 return date
6. July 22 - for 8/4/16 preliminary hearing
7. August 10 - for 10/24/16 (later amended)
8. August 17 - for 10/26/16 arraignment

**2018 (2 writs):**
9. February 22 - for 4/4/18 trial (Green Bay CI)
10. February 22 - duplicate/backup writ

**2019 (2 writs):**
11. December 2 - for 12/3/19 trial

**2020 (2 writs):**
12. December 17, 2019 - for 2/24/20 sentencing
13. February 17, 2020 - for 2/24/20 sentencing (closer to date)

**2021 (4 writs):**
14. August 16 - for Green Bay CI, 9/10/21 evidentiary hearing
15. August 16 - for Wisconsin Secure Program Facility, 9/10/21
16. October 27 - for Green Bay CI, 11/29/21 hearing
17. (Note: some writs were issued but hearings were continued)

**TOTAL: Approximately 17 writs of habeas corpus**

### **Pattern Analysis:**

**What This Reveals:**

1. **Continuous Incarceration:** Defendant was serving a prior sentence throughout these proceedings (caption notes "#244212" - DOC number)

2. **Multi-Institution Movement:**
   - Waupun Correctional Institution (initial, 2016)
   - Green Bay Correctional Institution (2016-2021)
   - Wisconsin Secure Program Facility (2021-present, maximum security)

3. **Logistical Burden:** Each court appearance required:
   - Petition for writ
   - Court order
   - Coordination between institution and Columbia County
   - Transport or video conferencing setup

4. **Video Conferencing Adoption:** Later proceedings (2019+) increasingly note "appeared by video" but still required writs for custody authorization

5. **Standard Practice:** This is **routine procedure** for incarcerated defendants, not indicative of excessive litigation. The writs are administrative transport authorizations, not substantive legal challenges.

6. **Post-Conviction Context:** The writ pattern shows defendant remained in DOC custody through appeal, which is typical when serving a consecutive sentence to a prior conviction (referenced in sentencing: "consecutive to any other sentence currently serving").

### **Frequency Analysis:**

| Motion Type | Count | Success Rate |
|-------------|-------|--------------|
| Continuances/Resets | 5+ | ~100% granted |
| Time Extensions (appellate) | 10+ | 100% granted |
| Discovery | 3 | Standard exchange |
| Motions in Limine | 2+ | Not fully detailed |
| **Motion to Dismiss (Speedy Trial)** | **1** | **DENIED at trial level** |
| **Post-conviction substantive** | **2** | **Initially denied, later WON on appeal** |

### **Motion Activity by Phase:**

**HIGHEST ACTIVITY: Post-Conviction/Appellate Phase (2020-2023)**
- At least **15+ motions** for extensions alone
- Multiple substantive post-conviction motions
- Evidentiary hearings required
- Court of Appeals remand generated additional motion cycle

**SECOND HIGHEST: Pre-Trial Phase (2016-2019)**
- Multiple continuance requests
- Discovery disputes
- Motions in limine
- Motion to dismiss
- Duration: **3+ years from arraignment to trial**

**LOWEST: Trial Phase (December 2019)**
- Minimal motion activity during actual trial
- 2-day trial proceeded efficiently once started

### **Strategic Pattern:**

1. **Defense Strategy:** Persistent focus on **speedy trial violation**
   - Demand filed 9/26/18
   - Motion to dismiss 4/15/19 (denied)
   - Post-conviction motion 6/21/21 (same ground)
   - **Strategy ultimately succeeded on appeal**

2. **State Strategy:** Sought continuances for legitimate reasons (witness availability, scheduling) but accumulated delay that became fatal on appeal

3. **Extension Practice:** Post-conviction phase shows routine granting of extensions for briefing/transcripts - standard appellate practice

## 🎯 KEY FINDINGS & SIGNIFICANCE

### **Timeline Statistics:**
- **Offense to Filing:** 9 months
- **Filing to Trial:** 3 years, 10 months
- **Trial to Sentencing:** 2.5 months
- **Sentencing to Appeal:** 27 months
- **Appeal to Reversal:** 23 months
- **Reversal to Final Remittitur:** 16 months
- **TOTAL CASE DURATION:** **10 years, 5 months** (May 2015 - October 2025)

### **Critical Turning Point:**
The **September 26, 2018 demand for speedy trial** triggered statutory timelines. The subsequent 15-month delay to trial (December 2019) became the foundation for the **successful appellate reversal**, despite being denied twice at the circuit court level.

### **Ultimate Outcome:**
After a **guilty verdict at jury trial** and **15-year consecutive sentence**, the defendant's conviction was **REVERSED and DISMISSED** by the Court of Appeals on speedy trial grounds. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reviewed the decision but the remittitur was ultimately issued, **vacating the conviction after 5+ years of post-conviction litigation**.

This case exemplifies the constitutional significance of speedy trial rights, even for defendants already serving prison sentences.
