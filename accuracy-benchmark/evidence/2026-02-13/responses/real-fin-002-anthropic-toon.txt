## KEY FINDINGS

### 6. Strongest Balance Sheet (Lowest Leverage):
**🏆 COSTCO** - Debt-to-Equity: 0.20
- Minimal debt load (only $5.7B vs $29.2B equity)
- Exceptional interest coverage of 67.4x
- Conservative capital structure appropriate for retail operations

### 7. Most Free Cash Flow Generation:
**🏆 APPLE** - FCF: $98,767M

- Operating cash flow of $111B with modest capex ($12.7B)
- Strongest absolute cash generation despite higher leverage

**Runner-up: VISA** - FCF: $21,577M (highest FCF margin at 54% of revenue)

### 8. Risk Assessment:

**⚠️ CONCERNING - APPLE:**
- **Debt-to-Equity of 1.34** (highest among the four)
- Total debt of $98.7B exceeds equity
- However, massive cash generation ($98.7B FCF) and strong cash position ($35.9B) mitigate concerns
- Debt appears strategic (low interest rates) rather than financial distress

**✅ ALL CLEAR:**
- **No companies with negative free cash flow**
- All four companies show strong interest coverage (Costco: 67x, Visa: 41x, Qualcomm: 19x)
- All generate substantial positive operating cash flows
- Visa, Costco, and Qualcomm maintain conservative leverage (all below 0.70)

**Overall Credit Quality: STRONG across all four companies**
- Technology and payment networks show asset-light, high-margin business models
- Costco demonstrates retail can maintain minimal leverage with strong operations
- All companies returned significant capital to shareholders while maintaining financial health
