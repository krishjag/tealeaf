## 1) Highest vs lowest average Job Openings rate (JO rate)

Average JO rate over 2025 (simple average of monthly rates):

**Highest (top 3)**
1. **Accommodation & food services (720000): ~5.93%**
2. **Leisure & hospitality (700000): ~5.82%**
3. **Health care & social assistance (620000): ~5.68%**  
*(Next: Professional & business services ~5.48%, Information ~4.89%)*

**Lowest (bottom 3)**
1. **Construction (230000): ~2.88%**
2. **Government (900000): ~3.33%**
3. **Manufacturing (300000): ~3.19%**  
*(Next: Retail trade ~3.54%)*

**Interpretation (labor demand):** High JO rates in leisure/hospitality and health care point to persistently high vacancy pressure—roles are harder to staff and/or turnover-driven replacement demand is large. Low JO rates in construction/manufacturing/government suggest comparatively less vacancy pressure (either weaker demand, better matching, slower growth, or more constrained hiring pipelines/budgets—especially in government).

## 2) Labor market churn (average of (hires level + total separations level)/2), ranked

Definition (monthly):  
\[
\text{churn}_m=\frac{\text{HI level}_m+\text{TS level}_m}{2}
\]
Then average across months.

**Average churn in 2025 (thousands), highest → lowest**
1. **Total private (100000): ~4,919**
2. **Total nonfarm (000000): ~5,272** *(note: includes government; levels are larger than private—if ranking “industries” including aggregates, Total nonfarm is actually the largest; see note below)*
3. **Professional & business services (540099): ~1,019**
4. **Leisure & hospitality (700000): ~964**
5. **Health care & social assistance (620000): ~696**
6. **Retail trade (440000): ~595**
7. **Government (900000): ~329**
8. **Manufacturing (300000): ~313**
9. **Construction (230000): ~344**
10. **Financial activities (510099): ~201**
11. **Information (510000): ~86**
12. **Accommodation & food services (720000): ~796**

**Important note on comparability:** churn in *levels* is heavily driven by industry size. A large sector can have high churn levels even with modest rates. For “true” churn intensity, you’d usually compute churn using **rates** (or normalize by employment).

## 3) Net hiring rate = avg hire rate − avg total separation rate

Using average rates over 2025:

- **Total nonfarm (000000):** HI ~3.35% − TS ~3.28% = **+0.07 pp** (growing slightly)
- **Total private (100000):** ~3.68% − ~3.62% = **+0.06 pp** (slightly growing)
- **Construction (230000):** ~4.18% − ~4.03% = **+0.15 pp** (growing)
- **Manufacturing (300000):** ~2.42% − ~2.46% = **−0.04 pp** (shrinking slightly)
- **Retail trade (440000):** ~3.82% − ~3.81% = **+0.01 pp** (flat)
- **Information (510000):** ~2.94% − ~3.07% = **−0.13 pp** (shrinking)
- **Financial activities (510099):** ~2.30% − ~2.20% = **+0.10 pp** (growing)
- **Professional & business services (540099):** ~4.58% − ~4.57% = **+0.01 pp** (flat)
- **Health care & social assistance (620000):** ~3.11% − ~2.80% = **+0.31 pp** (growing)
- **Leisure & hospitality (700000):** ~5.72% − ~5.58% = **+0.14 pp** (growing)
- **Accommodation & food services (720000):** ~5.62% − ~5.46% = **+0.16 pp** (growing)
- **Government (900000):** ~1.45% − ~1.38% = **+0.07 pp** (growing slightly)

**Growing (positive):** most sectors here, especially **health care** and **leisure-related**.  
**Shrinking (negative):** **Information** and **Manufacturing** (both mildly negative).

## 4) Leisure & hospitality vs Professional & business services (avg rates, all 6 metrics)

Averages over 2025 (rates):

| Metric (rate) | Leisure & hospitality (700000) | Prof & business services (540099) |
|---|---:|---:|
| **JO** | ~5.82 | ~5.48 |
| **HI** | ~5.72 | ~4.58 |
| **TS** | ~5.58 | ~4.57 |
| **QU** | ~4.04 | ~2.38 |
| **LD** | ~1.41 | ~2.02 |
| **OS** | ~0.13 | ~0.23 |

**Structural differences**
- **Much higher quit intensity in Leisure & hospitality** (QU ~4.0% vs ~2.4%): classic high-churn, worker-driven separations, shorter job tenures, and frequent job-to-job moves.
- **Higher layoff/discharge rate in Professional & business services** (LD ~2.0% vs ~1.4%): separations are more employer-driven relative to leisure, consistent with project/cycle sensitivity (e.g., staffing, contracting, business services adjustments).
- **Other separations are higher in PBS** (OS ~0.23% vs ~0.13%), consistent with a somewhat older/more career-tenured workforce and more non-quit exits.
- Both have **high JO rates**, but Leisure converts that into **even higher hires and separations rates**, indicating a “fast-flow” labor market.

## 5) Construction seasonality (hires level): highest, lowest, range

Construction hires levels (thousands) by month:
- **Highest:** **April = 364**
- **Lowest:** **March = 306**
- **Range:** 364 − 306 = **58 (thousand)**

---

## 6) Separation composition: quits vs layoffs vs other (levels), and highest quit/layoff shares

For each industry, compute annual totals of QU, LD, OS (sum of monthly levels) and divide by annual total separations (sum of TS levels). Using the fact that **TS = QU + LD + OS** each month, annual shares are consistent.

**Quit share (approx)**
- Total nonfarm: QU 38,299 / TS 63,698 ≈ **60.1%**
- Total private: 36,187 / 59,743 ≈ **60.6%**
- Construction: 1,770 / 4,110 ≈ **43.1%**
- Manufacturing: 2,161 / 3,762 ≈ **57.4%**
- Retail trade: 4,925 / 7,227 ≈ **68.1%**
- Information: 461 / 1,040 ≈ **44.3%**
- Financial activities: 1,452 / 2,416 ≈ **60.1%**
- Professional & business services: 6,460 / 12,260 ≈ **52.7%**
- Health care & social assistance: 5,557 / 7,900 ≈ **70.3%**
- Leisure & hospitality: 8,168 / 11,522 ≈ **70.9%**
- Accommodation & food services: 7,437 / 9,900 ≈ **75.1%**
- Government: 2,193 / 3,905 ≈ **56.2%**

**Layoff/discharge share (approx)**
- Construction: 2,053 / 4,110 ≈ **49.9%**
- Information: 503 / 1,040 ≈ **48.4%**
- Professional & business services: 5,369 / 12,260 ≈ **43.8%**
- (Most others are far lower; e.g., health care ~22%, leisure ~24%, accommodation/food ~16%)

**Highest quit share:** **Accommodation & food services (~75%)**  
**Highest layoff share:** **Construction (~50%)** *(Information is close at ~48%)*

## 7) “Ratio of unemployed persons implied by job openings” for Total nonfarm

To compute a **job openings–to–unemployed ratio** (or its inverse), you need **both**:
- Total nonfarm job openings level (you have this), and
- **Number of unemployed persons** (from CPS), or unemployment rate + labor force/employment to convert to unemployed level.

From your dataset we only have JOLTS series (openings/hires/separations), not CPS unemployment counts. So I can’t compute the ratio numerically without an external unemployment level.

What I *can* provide from your data:
- **Average Total nonfarm job openings in 2025:**  
  Sum JO levels = 87,418 (thousand-months) ⇒ average ≈ **7,285 thousand** openings.

If you provide (or allow me to use) the **average 2025 unemployed level** (in thousands) or monthly unemployed counts, then:
- **Openings-to-unemployed (tightness):** \( \text{JO}/U \)
- **Unemployed-per-opening:** \( U/\text{JO} \)

Example: if average unemployed were 6,000k, then JO/U ≈ 7,285/6,000 = 1.21 openings per unemployed (tight). If unemployed were 8,000k, JO/U ≈ 0.91 (looser).

--- 

If you want, I can also (a) redo churn ranking using **rates** (size-adjusted), and/or (b) compute the JO-to-unemployed ratio by pulling CPS unemployed levels if you confirm it’s okay to use external BLS CPS data.
