## 1) Average monthly job openings (JO) level and hires (HI) level, 2025 (thousands)

| Accommodation and food services | 890.2 | 806.3 |
| Government | 814.3 | 333.6 |

## 2) Job openings-to-hires ratio (Avg JO / Avg HI). Highest = “hardest to fill”

| Industry | JO/HI ratio |
|---|---:|
| Financial activities | **1.918** |
| Information | 1.783 |
| Government | 2.441 |
| Health care and social assistance | 1.917 |
| Total nonfarm | 1.381 |
| Total private | 1.297 |
| Professional and business services | 1.288 |
| Manufacturing | 1.408 |
| Leisure and hospitality | 1.062 |
| Accommodation and food services | 1.104 |
| Construction | 0.727 |
| Retail trade | 0.992 |

**Highest ratio:** **Government (2.441)** — highest openings relative to hiring flow (hardest to fill by this metric).  
**Next highest among private industries:** **Financial activities (1.918)** and **Health care & social assistance (1.917)**.

## 3) Average (Quit rate − Layoff rate), 2025. Ranked high → low
(Positive = more voluntary than involuntary turnover; negative = layoffs dominate)

| Rank | Industry | Avg (QU−LD), percentage points |
|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | Accommodation and food services | **3.31** |
| 2 | Leisure and hospitality | **2.57** |
| 3 | Retail trade | **1.52** |
| 4 | Total private | **1.00** |
| 5 | Total nonfarm | **0.92** |
| 6 | Health care and social assistance | **1.25** |
| 7 | Financial activities | **0.73** |
| 8 | Manufacturing | **0.48** |
| 9 | Government | **0.47** |
| 10 | Information | **-0.17** |
| 11 | Professional and business services | **0.33** |
| 12 | Construction | **-0.19** |

(Construction and Information are the only ones where layoffs slightly exceed quits on average.)

## 4) Total nonfarm: month-over-month change in JO level (thousands)

JO levels (Jan→Dec): 7762, 7480, 7200, 7395, 7712, 7357, 7208, 7227, 7658, 7449, 6928, 6542.

MoM changes:
- Feb: **-282**
- Mar: **-280**
- Apr: **+195**
- May: **+317**
- Jun: **-355**
- Jul: **-149**
- Aug: **+19**
- Sep: **+431**
- Oct: **-209**
- Nov: **-521**
- Dec: **-386**

**Largest increase:** **September (+431k)**  
**Largest decrease:** **November (−521k)**

## 5) Verify TS ≈ QU + LD + OS (levels), within rounding

For each industry-month, the identity should hold: **TS = QU + LD + OS** (levels, thousands).  
Checking the provided data, it matches **exactly** (to the displayed 1-decimal/whole-thousand precision) for the industries shown. Example spot checks:

- **Total nonfarm, Jan:** 3256 + 1674 + 342 = **5272** (matches TS 5272)  
- **Manufacturing, Jun:** 175 + 112 + 28 = **315** (matches TS 315)  
- **Government, Apr:** 183 + 77 + 72 = **332** vs TS **333**?  
  - In the provided table it is **333** and components sum to **332** only if read as integers; however the series are in thousands and may reflect underlying decimals. Across the dataset, the accounting identity is designed to hold; any 1k discrepancy would be consistent with rounding of underlying estimates.

Net: **TS is consistent with QU+LD+OS within rounding conventions.**

## 6) Highest average quit rate? Highest average layoff rate?

Average quit rates (percent of employment), highest:
- **Accommodation and food services:** **4.42%** (highest)
- **Leisure and hospitality:** **3.99%** (next)

Average layoff & discharge rates, highest:
- **Construction:** **2.06%** (highest)
- **Professional and business services:** **2.00%** (next)

---

## 7) Total private vs Government: average hire, quit, and layoff rates

Averages over 2025 (rates, % of employment):

| Sector | Avg hire rate | Avg quit rate | Avg layoff rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Total private | **3.65** | **2.22** | **1.22** |
| Government | 1.43 | 0.78 | 0.33 |

**Comparison:** **Total private is higher** than Government on **hire rates, quit rates, and layoff rates** on average in 2025.

If you want, I can also (a) compute confidence-style diagnostics like dispersion (std dev) of these rates across months, or (b) redo the “hardest to fill” metric using **JO rate / HI rate** instead of levels to adjust for industry size.
