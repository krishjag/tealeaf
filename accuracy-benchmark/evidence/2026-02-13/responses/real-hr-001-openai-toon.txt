## 1) Average monthly job openings (JO) level and hires (HI) level, 2025 (thousands)

Averages are simple means of the 12 seasonally adjusted monthly **levels**.

| Industry | Avg JO level | Avg HI level |
|---|---:|---:|
| Total nonfarm | 7,352 | 5,334 |
| Total private | 6,474 | 4,996 |
| Construction | 250 | 343 |
| Manufacturing | 424 | 299 |
| Retail trade | 590 | 590 |
| Information | 151 | 86 |
| Financial activities | 404 | 211 |
| Professional & business services | 1,326 | 1,022 |
| Health care & social assistance | 1,426 | 726 |
| Leisure & hospitality | 1,038 | 977 |
| Accommodation & food services | 890 | 807 |
| Government | 811 | 337 |

## 2) Job openings-to-hires ratio (avg JO / avg HI): “hardest to fill”

| Industry | Avg JO / Avg HI |
|---|---:|
| Financial activities | **1.92** |
| Health care & social assistance | 1.96 |
| Information | 1.76 |
| Manufacturing | 1.42 |
| Total nonfarm | 1.38 |
| Total private | 1.30 |
| Professional & business services | 1.30 |
| Government | 2.41 |
| Leisure & hospitality | 1.06 |
| Accommodation & food services | 1.10 |
| Construction | 0.73 |
| Retail trade | 1.00 |

**Highest ratio:** **Government (~2.41)**, indicating the highest average openings relative to hires (hardest to fill, by this metric).  
**Next highest:** Health care & social assistance (~1.96) and Financial activities (~1.92).

## 3) Average (quit rate − layoff rate) by industry; ranked high → low

Computed as the average over months of **(QU rate − LD rate)** (rates are % of employment).

| Rank | Industry | Avg (QU − LD), pp |
|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | Accommodation & food services | **+3.20** |
| 2 | Leisure & hospitality | +2.35 |
| 3 | Retail trade | +1.52 |
| 4 | Health care & social assistance | +1.20 |
| 5 | Total private | +1.00 |
| 6 | Total nonfarm | +0.92 |
| 7 | Government | +0.45 |
| 8 | Manufacturing | +0.48 |
| 9 | Financial activities | +0.73 |
| 10 | Construction | +0.02 |
| 11 | Information | **−0.13** |
| 12 | Professional & business services | +0.33 |

**Interpretation:** Accommodation/food and leisure/hospitality have the strongest “voluntary > involuntary” separation balance. **Information** is the only one with a slightly negative balance on average (layoffs exceeding quits).

## 4) Total nonfarm month-over-month change in JO level (thousands)

Change = JO(t) − JO(t−1).

- Feb: 7,480 − 7,762 = **−282**
- Mar: 7,200 − 7,480 = **−280**
- Apr: 7,395 − 7,200 = **+195**
- May: 7,712 − 7,395 = **+317**
- Jun: 7,357 − 7,712 = **−355**
- Jul: 7,208 − 7,357 = **−149**
- Aug: 7,227 − 7,208 = **+19**
- Sep: 7,658 − 7,227 = **+431**
- Oct: 7,449 − 7,658 = **−209**
- Nov: 6,928 − 7,449 = **−521**
- Dec: 6,542 − 6,928 = **−386**

**Largest increase:** **September (+431k)**  
**Largest decrease:** **November (−521k)**

## 5) Verify TS ≈ QU + LD + OS (levels), within rounding

For each industry-month, JOLTS total separations should equal quits + layoffs/discharges + other separations (levels), subject to rounding (levels are in thousands).

Spot checks (examples):

- **Total nonfarm, January:** QU 3,256 + LD 1,674 + OS 342 = **5,272**, matches TS **5,272** exactly.
- **Total private, April:** 3,032 + 1,712 + 236 = **4,980** vs TS **4,981** (difference **1** thousand; consistent with rounding).
- **Construction, March:** 166 + 150 + 5 = **321** vs TS **322** (difference **1** thousand; rounding).
- **Retail trade, February:** 404 + 229 + 12 = **645**, matches TS **645** exactly.
- **Information, December:** 60 + 47 + 3 = **110** vs TS **109** (difference **1** thousand; rounding).

**Conclusion:** The identity holds **within ±1 thousand** in the examples; that’s what you’d expect given rounding of component series.

## 6) Highest average quit rate and highest average layoff rate (rates)

Averages are over the 12 monthly **rates**.

- **Highest average quit rate:** **Accommodation & food services (~4.35%)**  
  (Leisure & hospitality is next at ~4.03%.)

- **Highest average layoff/discharge rate:** **Construction (~2.08%)**  
  (Professional & business services is next at ~1.98%.)

## 7) Total private vs Government: average hire, quit, and layoff rates

Average of monthly **rates**:

| Sector | Avg hire rate | Avg quit rate | Avg layoff rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Total private | **~3.68%** | **~2.20%** | **~1.20%** |
| Government | ~1.43% | ~0.78% | ~0.33% |

**Private sector is higher on all three margins** (hire rates, quit rates, and layoff rates), consistent with much higher overall labor market churn in private employment than in government.

If you want, I can also provide (a) the full industry-by-industry table of average quit and layoff rates used in items 3/6/7, and/or (b) the month-by-month TS identity check counts (how many months differ by 0, 1, 2 thousand, etc.).
