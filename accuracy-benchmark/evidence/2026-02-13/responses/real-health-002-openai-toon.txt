## 1) % of residents who are adults (18+)
Calculated as: **adult_population / population × 100**

| Pierce | 928,696 | 716,813 | 77.2% |
| Spokane | 551,455 | 433,863 | 78.7% |
| Clark | 521,150 | 405,348 | 77.8% |
| Yakima | 256,643 | 183,160 | 71.4% |
| Whatcom | 231,919 | 189,784 | 81.8% |
| Benton | 215,219 | 159,518 | 74.1% |
| Island | 86,267 | 71,614 | 83.0% |
| Ferry | 7,497 | 6,217 | 82.9% |
| Garfield | 2,363 | 1,865 | 78.9% |

**Highest % adults:** Island (83.0%), Ferry (82.9%)  
**Lowest % adults:** Yakima (71.4%)

## 2) Composite “chronic disease burden” score (average of 6 measures)
Measures averaged (crude prevalence, %): **ARTHRITIS, BPHIGH, DIABETES, CHD, COPD, STROKE**.

| County | Chronic disease burden score |
|---|---:|
| King | 10.6 |
| Pierce | 13.7 |
| Spokane | 13.8 |
| Clark | 13.4 |
| Yakima | 14.3 |
| Whatcom | 12.6 |
| Benton | 13.1 |
| Island | 15.1 |
| Ferry | 19.9 |
| Garfield | 16.6 |

(Example: King = (19.4+26.7+7.3+4.0+3.4+2.3)/6 = 10.52 → 10.6)

---

## 3) Rank (highest to lowest) by chronic disease burden
1. **Ferry** — 19.9  
2. **Garfield** — 16.6  
3. **Island** — 15.1  
4. **Yakima** — 14.3  
5. **Spokane** — 13.8  
6. **Pierce** — 13.7  
7. **Clark** — 13.4  
8. **Benton** — 13.1  
9. **Whatcom** — 12.6  
10. **King** — 10.6

## 4) Disability burden: average DISABLT prevalence per county
Averaged across the 7 disability measures: **COGNITION, DISABILITY, HEARING, INDEPLIVE, MOBILITY, SELFCARE, VISION**.

| County | Avg disability prevalence |
|---|---:|
| King | 7.8 |
| Pierce | 11.4 |
| Spokane | 11.2 |
| Clark | 10.6 |
| Yakima | 13.8 |
| Whatcom | 11.0 |
| Benton | 11.1 |
| Island | 10.5 |
| Ferry | 15.4 |
| Garfield | 11.7 |

**Highest disability burden:** **Ferry (15.4%)**

---

## 5) Preventive service utilization leaders (PREVENT)
Highest values among the 10 counties:

- **Dental visit (DENTAL):** **King — 71.8%**
- **Mammography (MAMMOUSE):** **Spokane — 76.9%**
- **Cholesterol screening (CHOLSCREEN):** **Garfield — 86.4%**

---

## 6) Population-weighted average obesity (OBESITY), weighted by adult_population
Weighted mean formula:  
\[
\frac{\sum(\text{adult pop}_i \times \text{obesity}_i)}{\sum(\text{adult pop}_i)}
\]

**Population-weighted obesity prevalence (adults) across all 10 counties: 27.9%**

(Adult-population total used: 4,004,711)

---

## 7) For each category, measure with the highest overall *average prevalence* across counties
Computed as the simple mean of the measure’s prevalence across the 10 counties (not population-weighted).

### HLTHOUT (Health Outcomes)
- **High blood pressure (BPHIGH)** — average **32.7%** (highest in this category)

### HLTHSTAT (Health Status)
- **Frequent mental distress (MHLTH)** — average **16.8%** (highest)

### PREVENT (Prevention)
- **Cholesterol screening (CHOLSCREEN)** — average **83.8%** (highest)

### RISKBEH (Health Risk Behaviors)
- **Short sleep duration (SLEEP)** — average **31.5%** (highest)

### DISABLT (Disability)
- **Any disability (DISABILITY)** — average **29.9%** (highest)

### HRSN (Health-Related Social Needs)
- **Not computable from the provided extract** (no HRSN measure values were included in the county data shown). If you share the HRSN rows/measures for these counties, I can compute this the same way.

---

### Notes / interpretation cautions (brief)
- These are **crude prevalence estimates** (not age-adjusted). Counties with older age structures can appear to have higher chronic disease/disability burden partly due to age composition.
- Very small counties (e.g., Ferry, Garfield) can have more model-based uncertainty even when CIs look reasonably tight.

If you want, I can also (a) add uncertainty-aware comparisons using confidence intervals, or (b) compute category-wide population-weighted averages.
