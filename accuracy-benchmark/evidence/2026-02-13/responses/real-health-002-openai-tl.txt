## 6) Population-weighted average obesity (OBESITY) across all 10 counties (weighted by adult_population)
Weighted mean = \(\sum(\text{adult_pop}_i \times \text{obesity}_i) / \sum(\text{adult_pop}_i)\)

- Total adult population (10 counties): **4,004,711**
- Population-weighted obesity prevalence: **28.17%**

---

## 7) For each category, measure with the highest overall average prevalence (across counties)
Computed as the simple mean of the measure’s prevalence across the 10 counties within each category.

- **HLTHOUT (Health Outcomes):** **HIGHCHOL** (High cholesterol) — avg **35.11%**
- **HLTHSTAT (Health Status):** **GHLTH** (Fair/poor self-rated health) — avg **18.30%**
- **PREVENT (Prevention):** **CHOLSCREEN** (Cholesterol screening) — avg **83.78%**
- **RISKBEH (Risk Behaviors):** **SLEEP** (Short sleep duration) — avg **31.51%**
- **DISABLT (Disability):** **DISABILITY** (Any disability) — avg **29.90%**

If you want, I can also provide uncertainty-aware comparisons (e.g., flagging where confidence intervals overlap vs. clearly different), but the rankings above use point estimates only.
