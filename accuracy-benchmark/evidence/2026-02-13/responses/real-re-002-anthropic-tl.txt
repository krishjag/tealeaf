- **MiD (Midtown) special district** appears frequently in spdist1, indicating many properties benefit from Midtown zoning bonuses

### Key Findings:
- **NO clear correlation between age and value** - the #1 property (185 Greenwich, $1.67B) was built in 2009, but #12 (Empire State, $534M) was built in 1931
- **Highest average values are in 2000s-2010s buildings** ($677-740M avg), likely reflecting:
  - Modern construction with higher density
  - Better amenities and LEED certification
  - Recent market valuations
- **1930s buildings still highly valuable** (avg $461M), especially iconic towers like Empire State Building
- **1940s-1950s buildings are rarest** (only 2 total), reflecting WWII construction slowdown

## 5. Top Property Owners by Total Assessed Value

| Rank | Owner | Properties | Total Assessed Value | Individual Properties |
|------|-------|------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Rockefeller Center Properties** | 3 | **$1,678,856,379** | • 1250 Ave Americas ($619.0M)<br>• 1271 Ave Americas ($470.0M)<br>• 1251 Ave Americas ($511.2M) |

| 4 | **NYC CONVENTION CENTER** | 1 | **$931,422,600** | • 360 West St ($931.4M) |
| 5 | **BPP ST OWNER LLC** | 1 | **$791,815,950** | • 240 1st Ave/Stuy Town ($791.8M) |

### Ownership Concentration Analysis:

- **Top 5 owners control 27.5%** of total value ($5.29B of $18.26B)
- **20 different owners** appear in the dataset
- **Multiple-property owners:**
  - Rockefeller Center Properties: 3 properties (all Rockefeller Center complex buildings)
  - "UNAVAILABLE OWNER": 3 properties (likely condominiums with complex ownership)
  
### Public vs Private Ownership:

**Public/Quasi-Public (5 properties, 22.8% of total value):**
- Lower Manhattan Development Corporation: $1.67B (3 WTC)
- NYC Convention Center: $931.4M
- NYC Dept of Cultural Affairs: $474.4M (Natural History Museum)
- Presbyterian Hospital: $460.3M
- Riverwalk 8 Affordable LP: $534.0M (affordable housing)

**Private Institutional (majority):**
- REITs and LLCs dominate with single trophy properties

**Key Insight:** Ownership is **relatively fragmented** - no single private owner dominates. The Rockefeller Center complex represents the only significant concentration of multiple properties under one entity.

## 6. Lot Coverage Analysis

### Lot Coverage Calculation:
`Coverage Ratio = (bldgfront × bldgdepth) / lotarea`

Note: Some properties have bldgfront/bldgdepth = 0 (reported as such in data), which makes this calculation impossible for those properties.

### Highest Lot Coverage (Most Intensive Development):

| Property | Lot Area | Bldg Footprint* | Coverage % | FAR | Floors |
|----------|----------|----------------|------------|-----|--------|
| **527 W 34th** | 67,397 sf | 0 sf (N/A) | **N/A** | 32.96 | 66 |
| **51 E 42nd (One Vanderbilt)** | 44,048 sf | 43,339 sf | **98.4%** | 38.1 | 60 |
| **761 5th Ave** | 84,350 sf | 63,171 sf | **74.9%** | 21.63 | 50 |
| **9 W 57th** | 62,058 sf | 50,216 sf | **80.9%** | 27.37 | 49 |
| **1631 Broadway** | 90,400 sf | 67,335 sf | **74.5%** | 26.97 | 48 |

### Lowest Lot Coverage (Tower-in-Park / Open Space):

| Property | Lot Area | Bldg Footprint* | Coverage % | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------------|------------|-------|
| **Main Street (Roosevelt)** | 4,227,757 sf | 0 | **0%** | Large residential complex, footprint not reported |
| **Presbyterian Hospital** | 364,433 sf | 0 | **0%** | Hospital campus |
| **200 CPW (Museum)** | 738,000 sf | 120,000 sf | **16.2%** | Museum with extensive grounds |
| **240 1st Ave (Stuy Town)** | 2,675,000 sf | 2,753,226 sf | **103%** | Data error or multi-building complex |

### Pattern Analysis:

**Ultra-High Lot Coverage (>70%):**
- Midtown office towers on small lots
- Maximize building envelope to lot lines
- Typical of C5/C6 zoning allowing high FAR

**Low Lot Coverage (<30%):**
- Institutional campuses (hospitals, museums)
- Large residential complexes
- Properties with public spaces/plazas

**Correlation with FAR:**
- High coverage properties: Avg FAR = **28.9**
- Low coverage properties: Avg FAR = **3.1**
- High coverage + many floors = maximum density

**Data Quality Note:** 8 properties have bldgfront=0 or bldgdepth=0, indicating these fields aren't consistently reported. This is common in PLUTO data for complex buildings.

### Geographic Insights:

1. **Midtown Dominance:** 50% of total value ($9.1B) concentrated in Midtown (40.75-40.765 latitude)
   - Avenue of the Americas corridor has 7 properties worth $3.9B
   - This reflects Manhattan's CBD concentration

2. **Hudson Yards/West Side Emergence:** 21.3% of value ($3.9B)
   - All built/renovated 2013-2019
   - Reflects recent development boom
   - Manufacturing zones (M1-5, M2-3) converted to commercial

3. **Two Distinct Clusters:**
   - **Midtown Core:** Dense cluster of office towers, 15 properties within 0.015° latitude (~1.5 miles)
   - **West Side/Hudson Yards:** Linear development along 10th-11th Avenues

4. **Limited Downtown Presence:** Only 2 properties (12%) in Financial District
   - Despite being historic center, fewer mega-towers than Midtown
   - 185 Greenwich (3 WTC) is notable exception at #1

5. **Property Type by Location:**
   - **Midtown Core:** Pure office towers (O4 class), C5/C6 zoning
   - **West Side:** Mixed office/residential (RC class), newer construction
   - **Outer areas:** Institutional (hospitals, museums) or residential

**Key Finding:** Manhattan's highest-value real estate forms a **"Golden Triangle"** bounded by:
- North: 59th Street (Central Park)
- South: 42nd Street
- West: 11th Avenue (Hudson Yards)

This zone contains 70% of the top 30 properties by value.
