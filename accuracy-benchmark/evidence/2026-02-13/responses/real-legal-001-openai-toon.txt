## 5) Appeal-related docket entries (Court of Appeals / Supreme Court) and percentage

### Appeal-related entries (count)
Entries that explicitly reference the **Court of Appeals** or **Supreme Court** (including “Order of Court of Appeals,” “Acknowledgment from Court of Appeals,” “Transmittal of record to court of appeals,” “Supreme Court decision filed,” etc.):

- **Total appeal-related docket entries:** **24**

## 6) Receivables calculations (due/paid/balance/% collected)

Receivables record (single line) shows:
- **Amount due:** 761  
- **Paid:** 352  
- **Balance due:** 0  
- **Adjust:** 0  
- (Also shows “docCollected: true” and other fields)

Calculations:
- **Total amount due:** **$761**
- **Total paid:** **$352**
- **Remaining balance (amount due − paid):** **$409**  
  - However, the receivable line also reports **balanceDue = 0**, which suggests the remaining $409 may have been satisfied via something not reflected as “paid” here (e.g., waiver, conversion, other accounting treatment), or the fields represent different concepts in WCCA export.
- **% collected (paid ÷ amount due):** 352 / 761 ≈ **46.3%**

So, **$352 (46.3%)** is shown as paid against **$761 assessed**, while the system-reported **balance due is $0**.

## 7) Bond amount + bond-related docket entries and dates

### Bond amount
- **Signature bond set:** **$5,000** (“with felony conds.”)

(There are also hearing entries on 2016-02-11 referencing the $5,000 recognizance/signature bond, but the two entries above are the direct bond entries.)
