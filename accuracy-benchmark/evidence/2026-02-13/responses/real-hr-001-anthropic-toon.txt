## 7. Private Sector vs. Government Comparison

| Metric | Total Private | Government | Difference |
|--------|--------------|------------|------------|
| **Average Hire Rate** | 3.68% | 1.45% | Private +2.23 pp |
| **Average Quit Rate** | 2.21% | 0.80% | Private +1.41 pp |
| **Average Layoff Rate** | 1.23% | 0.33% | Private +0.90 pp |

**Key Findings:**
- **Private sector has significantly higher turnover** across all measures
- Private sector hire rates are **2.5× higher** than government
