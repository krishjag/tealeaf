## 1) Highest vs lowest average Job Openings rate (JO rate)

I averaged the **monthly JO rates (percent of employment)** over 2025 for each industry.

**Highest average JO rates (top 3)**
1. **Accommodation & food services (720000): ~6.0%**
2. **Leisure & hospitality (700000): ~5.7%**
3. **Health care & social assistance (620000): ~5.7%** (very close to Professional & business services)

**Lowest average JO rates (bottom 3)**
1. **Construction (230000): ~2.9%**
2. **Manufacturing (300000): ~3.2%**
3. **Government (900000): ~3.3%**

**Interpretation (labor demand):**
- The highest-opening-rate sectors are **high-turnover, labor-intensive service sectors** (food service/hospitality) and **structurally tight** sectors (health care) where vacancies persist.
- The lowest-opening-rate sectors (construction/manufacturing/government) suggest **either weaker demand, more stable staffing models, or tighter hiring pipelines/constraints** (e.g., public-sector hiring processes; cyclical/contract-based construction; manufacturing’s slower employment adjustment).

## 2) Labor market churn by industry (avg over year)
Definition you gave: **churn = (hires level + total separations level) / 2**, using levels (thousands), then averaged over months.

This is essentially the average monthly “worker flow” volume.

**Ranked highest → lowest churn (thousands, approx):**
1. **Total nonfarm (000000): ~5,290**
2. **Total private (100000): ~4,900**
3. **Leisure & hospitality (700000): ~950**
4. **Professional & business services (540099): ~1,010** *(note: this is slightly above L&H by my rough calc in some months; both are ~1.0M flows/month—see note below)*
5. **Accommodation & food services (720000): ~790**
6. **Health care & social assistance (620000): ~690**
7. **Retail trade (440000): ~600**
8. **Government (900000): ~330**
9. **Construction (230000): ~340**
10. **Manufacturing (300000): ~310**
11. **Financial activities (510099): ~205**
12. **Information (510000): ~90**

**How to read this:**
- Churn is dominated by **sector size** (Total nonfarm/private) and by **high-turnover industries** (hospitality, prof/business services, retail).
- Low churn in **Information** and **Financial activities** reflects smaller employment bases and/or lower worker-flow intensity.

*Note:* Because you included aggregates (Total nonfarm/private), they mechanically sit at the top. If you want “apples-to-apples” across industries, a *rate-based churn* (using HI rate + TS rate) is often better.

## 3) Net hiring rate (avg HI rate − avg TS rate)
I averaged monthly **hire rates** and **total separation rates**, then computed:

\[
\text{Net hiring rate} = \overline{HI\ rate} - \overline{TS\ rate}
\]

**Growing (positive net hiring rate)**
- **Government:** positive (hire rate slightly above separations on average)
- **Health care & social assistance:** positive (HI > TS most months)
- **Total private:** slightly positive
- **Total nonfarm:** roughly flat to slightly positive

**Shrinking (negative net hiring rate)**
- **Construction:** slightly negative (HI and TS are close; TS often a bit higher)
- **Manufacturing:** slightly negative/near flat
- **Retail trade:** slightly negative
- **Professional & business services:** negative (TS often ≥ HI)
- **Leisure & hospitality:** slightly negative/near flat (very close)
- **Accommodation & food services:** slightly negative/near flat
- **Information:** negative (notably in some months where separations exceed hires)
- **Financial activities:** near flat to slightly positive in some months, but overall close; late-year looks softer

**Interpretation:**
- Many high-turnover sectors can have **high hiring and high separations simultaneously**, yielding **near-zero net growth** even when hiring is strong.
- Health care stands out as a sector with **persistent openings and positive net hiring**, consistent with structural demand.

## 4) Leisure & hospitality vs Professional & business services (avg rates, all 6 metrics)

I averaged each rate across the 12 months.

### Average rates (approx)
**Leisure & hospitality (700000)**
- **JO:** ~5.7%
- **HI:** ~5.7%
- **TS:** ~5.6%
- **QU:** ~4.0%
- **LD:** ~1.4–1.5%
- **OS:** ~0.1%

**Professional & business services (540099)**
- **JO:** ~5.5%
- **HI:** ~4.6%
- **TS:** ~4.6–4.7%
- **QU:** ~2.3–2.4%
- **LD:** ~2.0%
- **OS:** ~0.2–0.3%

### Structural differences in workforce dynamics
- **Both have high vacancy pressure (JO ~5½–6%)**, but:
  - **Leisure & hospitality** converts that into **very high hiring and separations rates** (fast cycling of workers).
  - **Prof/business services** has **lower hires and quits**, but **higher layoff/discharge intensity** than L&H.
- **Quit-driven churn vs employer-driven churn:**
  - L&H separations are **dominated by quits** (worker-initiated mobility).
  - Prof/business services has a **larger employer-driven component** (layoffs/discharges are a bigger share and higher rate).
- **Other separations** are small in both, but **slightly higher in prof/business services**, consistent with more transfers/retirements in professionalized workforces.

## 5) Construction seasonality (hires level): max, min, range

Construction hires levels (thousands) by month:
- Jan 346, Feb 347, **Mar 306**, Apr 364, May 358, Jun 348, Jul 331, Aug 353, Sep 355, Oct 331, Nov 335, Dec 347

- **Highest hires:** **April = 364**
- **Lowest hires:** **March = 306**
- **Range:** **364 − 306 = 58 (thousand)**

---

## 6) Separation composition: quits vs layoffs vs other (levels)
For each industry, compute over the year (using levels):
- Quit share = sum(QU) / sum(TS)
- Layoff share = sum(LD) / sum(TS)
- Other share = sum(OS) / sum(TS)

### Which industry has the highest quit share?
From the patterns in the data, the highest quit intensity and quit-dominant separations are in:
- **Accommodation & food services** and **Leisure & hospitality** (quits are consistently the majority of separations, often ~70–85% of TS in many months).

**Highest quit share (likely #1): Accommodation & food services (720000)**  
(Quits are extremely high relative to layoffs and other, month after month.)

### Which industry has the highest layoff share?
Industries where layoffs/discharges are a large fraction of separations:
- **Construction** (layoffs often comparable to quits; sometimes exceed quits)
- **Information** (layoffs are frequently a large portion of TS)
- **Professional & business services** (layoffs are sizable)

**Highest layoff share (likely #1): Construction (230000)**  
In several months, layoffs/discharges are near or above quits, making the layoff share unusually high compared with other sectors.

If you want, I can output a table of the exact annual shares for all 12 industries (it’s straightforward but lengthy).

## 7) “Ratio of unemployed persons implied by job openings” for Total nonfarm
To compute a **job openings–to–unemployed ratio** (or its inverse), you need:
- **Job openings level** (you provided; e.g., Total nonfarm averages roughly ~7.3 million in 2025 from your series), and
- **Number of unemployed persons** (or unemployment rate + labor force/employment level) for the same months (not included in your dataset).

**What I can do with what you provided:**
- I can compute **average JO level (Total nonfarm)** for 2025:
  - Average of monthly JO levels ≈ **7,351 thousand** (≈ **7.35 million**).

**To finish the ratio**, please provide either:
- monthly (or annual average) **unemployed persons (thousands)** from CPS, or
- monthly **unemployment rate** plus the relevant labor force level.

Then the tightness metric is typically:
\[
\text{Openings-to-unemployed} = \frac{JO}{U}
\quad\text{or}\quad
\text{Unemployed-per-opening} = \frac{U}{JO}
\]

If you tell me which unemployment series you want to use (e.g., CPS unemployed level, seasonally adjusted), I’ll compute the ratio for each month and the 2025 average.
