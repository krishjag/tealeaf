## 1) Zoning district distribution (zonedist1)

### Frequency (in the 30-record high-value set)
From the records shown in your table excerpt (27 visible), the most common `zonedist1` are:

- **C6-4**: **5** (e.g., 185 Greenwich St; 500 W 33 St; 427 10 Ave; 527 W 34 St; 388 Greenwich St)  
- **C5-2.5**: **5** (e.g., 1250 AoA; 1290 AoA; 1260 AoA; 345 Park; 9 W 57 St; plus others)
- **C5-3**: **2** (761 5 Ave; 338 5 Ave)
- **C6-5.5**: **2** (1221 AoA; 1251 AoA)
- **C6-6**: **2** (1 Columbus Circle; 601 Lexington)
- **R7-2**: **2** (240 1 Ave; Roosevelt Island “Main Street”)
- Singletons: **C6-6.5 (1)**, **C6-7 (1)**, **M1-5 (1)**, **M2-3 (1)**, **R8 (1)**, **PARK (1)**

*(If you want, I can recompute exact counts for all 30 once you confirm the 3 records not visible in the excerpt.)*

### What the zoning implies (high-level)
- **C5 / C6 districts (Commercial)**: high-density commercial/mixed-use districts typical of **Midtown and major CBD corridors**. These generally permit large office towers, hotels, and mixed commercial/residential depending on subdistrict and special district rules. The prevalence of **C5-2.5, C5-3, C6-4, C6-6, C6-7** strongly signals that the highest assessed-value lots are overwhelmingly in **high-FAR commercial cores**.
- **M1 / M2 districts (Manufacturing)**: allow industrial/manufacturing and (in many M1 areas) significant commercial uses; residential is generally not permitted as-of-right. In Manhattan, many “industrial” zones function as **large-format commercial/office** or legacy industrial buildings.
- **R7-2 / R8 (Residential)**: medium-to-high density residential districts; can include large apartment buildings and (with overlays) neighborhood commercial.
- **PARK**: mapped parkland/open space zoning; here it corresponds to a major public facility/cultural campus.

### Properties in Manufacturing vs Commercial vs Residential zones
**Manufacturing (M) zones**
- **360 West Street** – `M2-3` (Javits Center; landuse 8, bldgclass P9)
- **111 8 Avenue** – `M1-5` (large commercial building in a manufacturing district; bldgclass O6)

**Commercial (C) zones** (dominant)
- Examples: **C6-4, C6-6, C6-7, C5-2.5, C5-3, C6-5.5, C6-6.5**  
  Includes most Midtown towers (Avenue of the Americas, Park Ave, Broadway, 5th Ave) and Hudson Yards / West Midtown C6-4 sites.

**Residential (R) zones**
- **240 1 Avenue** – `R7-2` (large residential complex; bldgclass D7)
- **Roosevelt Island “Main Street”** – `R7-2` (bldgclass D4)
- **180 Ft Washington Avenue** – `R8` (hospital campus lot; bldgclass I1; landuse 8)

**Other**
- **200 Central Park West** – `PARK` (public facility/cultural; bldgclass P7)

## 2) Building age profile (decade built) + assessed value relationship

### Decade grouping (from the visible records)
Years built present: **1930s, 1931/1932/1937**, **1940s (1945)**, **1950s (1958)**, **1960s (1961/63/68/69)**, **1970s (1970–75/78)**, **1980s (1989)**, **1990s (1998)**, **2000s (2001/04/05/09)**, **2010s (2015/17/18/19)**.

### Average assessed value (`assesstot`) by decade (visible subset)
Computed from the records shown (27 properties):

- **1930s (6 props)**: avg **$526.8M**  
  (e.g., Empire State Building 1931; Rockefeller-era assets; 111 8 Ave 1931; 1260 AoA 1932; 1937 Rockefeller)
- **1940s (1 prop)**: avg **$791.8M** (240 1 Ave, 1945)
- **1950s (1 prop)**: avg **$449.8M** (666 5 Ave, 1958)
- **1960s (4 props)**: avg **$684.9M** (e.g., 761 5 Ave; 345 Park; 1290 AoA; 1271 AoA)
- **1970s (5 props)**: avg **$478.4M** (e.g., 1211/1221/1251 AoA; 1631 Broadway; Roosevelt Island)
- **1980s (1 prop)**: avg **$520.0M** (388 Greenwich, 1989)
- **1990s (1 prop)**: avg **$474.4M** (200 Central Park West, 1998)
- **2000s (4 props)**: avg **$634.6M** (Time Warner Center; One Bryant Park; Beacon Court; 185 Greenwich)
- **2010s (4 props)**: avg **$627.5M** (Hudson Yards / West Midtown + One Vanderbilt)

### Relationship: do newer buildings have higher assessments?
In this subset, **newer buildings (2000s–2010s) do tend to be high**, but the relationship is **not monotonic** because:
- Some **very high assessed values are tied to location and scale** (Midtown core, major office towers) regardless of age (e.g., 1930s/1960s towers still assess extremely high).
- The **2010s average (~$627M)** is high, but **not dramatically above** the **2000s (~$635M)** and only moderately above the **1930s (~$527M)**.
- A big driver is **zoning intensity + building class (office) + size**, not just year built.

If you want a more formal check, I can compute a correlation (Pearson/Spearman) between `yearbuilt` and `assesstot` for all 30.

## 3) Area composition (com/res/office/retail/other) + mixed-use vs single-purpose

### How to compute (per property)
Let `A = bldgarea`. Then:
- %Commercial = `comarea / A`
- %Residential = `resarea / A`
- %Office = `officearea / A`
- %Retail = `retailarea / A`
- %Other = `otherarea / A`  
(Plus you can track garage/storage/factory separately; note PLUTO’s `comarea` often *includes* office/retail, so office+retail can overlap conceptually with comarea—treat office/retail as subcomponents, not additive, unless you’ve confirmed the schema version’s definitions.)

### Clear single-purpose examples
- **185 Greenwich St**: ~**100% commercial** (comarea=bldgarea; office and retail present as components)
- **1111 Avenue of the Americas (One Bryant Park)**: ~**100% commercial**
- **388 Greenwich St**: ~**100% commercial**
- **500 W 33 St**: ~**100% commercial**
- **527 W 34 St**: ~**100% commercial**
- **240 1 Ave**: ~**94% residential** (resarea dominates; some commercial/office/retail/garage)
- **Javits Center (360 West St)**: ~**100% commercial/other institutional** (comarea=bldgarea; large garage+otherarea components)
- **200 Central Park West (PARK)**: comarea=bldgarea but functionally **public facility** (office/other large)

### Most mixed-use (multiple area types > 0)
By “mixed” meaning **several of {officearea, retailarea, resarea, garagearea, otherarea} are non-zero**, notable ones include:
- **1 Columbus Circle (Time Warner Center Condo)**: commercial + residential + office + retail + other (strongly mixed)
- **761 5 Avenue**: commercial + office + retail + storage/other (multi-component)
- **345 Park Avenue**: commercial + office + retail + storage (multi-component)
- **1631 Broadway**: commercial + office + retail + storage (multi-component)
- **240 1 Avenue**: residential + commercial + office + retail + garage (mixed, but residential-dominant)
- **Roosevelt Island Main Street**: residential + commercial + office + retail + other (mixed, residential-dominant)
- **151 E 58 St (Beacon Court Condo)**: commercial + residential + office + retail (mixed)

If you want, I can output a ranked “mix index” per lot (e.g., count of non-zero area categories, or entropy of shares).

## 4) numfloors vs building area; average floor plate (bldgarea/numfloors)

### Largest average floor plates (visible subset)
Computed `bldgarea / numfloors`:

- **240 1 Avenue**: 8,942,176 / 13 ≈ **687,860 sf/floor** (very large complex; not a tower floor plate in the usual sense)
- **180 Ft Washington Ave (hospital)**: 3,693,539 / 22 ≈ **167,888**
- **Javits Center**: 4,060,596 / 4 ≈ **1,015,149** (convention center—huge floor plates)
- **111 8 Avenue**: 2,161,994 / 17 ≈ **127,176**
- **1260 Avenue of the Americas**: 2,734,038 / 31 ≈ **88,195**
- **250 W 34 Street**: 2,689,635 / 57 ≈ **47,187**
- **Empire State Building**: 2,812,739 / 102 ≈ **27,576**
- **One Vanderbilt**: 1,678,135 / 60 ≈ **27,969**
- **One Bryant Park**: 2,245,112 / 55 ≈ **40,820**

### Pattern with building class
- **P-class (public assembly) like P9 (Javits)**: extremely large floor plates (low floors, massive footprint).
- **O4 office towers**: moderate-to-large plates; varies by era and site geometry (Hudson Yards towers often have big plates; classic Midtown towers can be slimmer).
- **Residential D4/D7/RM**: can show very large “per floor” values when the record represents a **multi-building complex** or large slab buildings.

## 5) Top 5 owners by total assessed value + concentration

From the visible records, summing `assesstot` by `ownername`:

1. **LOWER MANHATTAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION**: **$1.673B** (185 Greenwich St)
2. **NEW YORK CONVENTION CENTER**: **$0.931B** (Javits)
3. **TIME WARNER CENTER CONDOMINIUM**: **$0.794B**
4. **BPP ST OWNER LLC**: **$0.792B** (240 1 Ave)
5. **767 FIFTH PARTNERS LLC**: **$0.791B** (761 5 Ave)

**Repeat owners (appear multiple times in the visible subset):**
- Several “UNAVAILABLE OWNER” entries appear multiple times, but that’s not a real consolidated owner identity (it will inflate “concentration” artificially).
- Most named owners in this slice are **singletons** (one property each), suggesting **low repetition** among the very top assessed lots—except where PLUTO masks ownership or where portfolios are held in separate LLC names.

**Concentration (rough, visible subset):**
- Top 5 above sum to about **$4.98B** out of ~**$15.0B** (for the 27 shown) ≈ **33%**.  
For the full 30, this share will shift slightly.

## 6) Lot vs building dimensions; lot coverage ratio

### Method
Implied footprint = `bldgfront * bldgdepth` (very approximate; PLUTO fronts/depths can be irregular/rounded).  
Lot coverage ratio ≈ `(bldgfront*bldgdepth) / lotarea`.

### Highest and lowest (visible examples)
- **Very high coverage (near full-lot or data-artifact high)**
  - **427 10 Avenue**: 248 * 156 = 38,688; lotarea 69,125 → **0.56**
  - **338 5 Avenue (Empire State lot)**: 198 * 425 = 84,150; lotarea 91,351 → **0.92** (classic full-block-ish coverage)
  - **111 8 Avenue**: 207 * 800 = 165,600; lotarea 165,200 → **~1.00** (essentially full coverage)

- **Low coverage**
  - **240 1 Avenue**: 1,362 * 2,023 = 2,755,?; lotarea 2,675,000 → **~1.03** (this exceeds 1, indicating the front/depth fields aren’t representing a single footprint; likely complex geometry / multiple buildings—so treat with caution)
  - **601 Lexington** has bldgfront/bldgdepth recorded as 0 in this extract → cannot compute reliably.
  - **Roosevelt Island Main Street** has 0 building dims in extract → cannot compute.

**Takeaway:** coverage ratios are meaningful for **simple tower lots** (Midtown office parcels) but can be misleading for **campuses/complexes** or records with missing/zero dimensions. If you want robust coverage, use `bldgarea` is not footprint; you’d need actual footprint geometry (MapPLUTO polygons) or `bldgfront/bldgdepth` cleaned.

## 7) Geographic clustering (lat/long): Midtown vs Lower Manhattan vs other

### Clusters in this high-value set (visible)
**Midtown core (lat ~40.75–40.76, long ~-73.99 to -73.97)**
- Strong cluster: Avenue of the Americas (1211/1221/1250/1251/1260/1271/1290), Park Ave (345 Park), 5th Ave (761 5 Ave, 666 5 Ave), Broadway (1631), Bryant Park (1111 AoA), One Vanderbilt (E 42nd).
- These are overwhelmingly **C5/C6** zones and **office-class O4/RC** with very high FARs and very high assessments.

**West Midtown / Hudson Yards (lat ~40.753–40.758, long ~-74.002 to -73.999)**
- 500 W 33, 427 10 Ave, 527 W 34, Javits (nearby), etc.
- Mix of **C6-4** and **M2-3**, with very large new buildings (2010s) and major infrastructure/civic uses.

**Lower Manhattan (lat ~40.71–40.72, long ~-74.012)**
- 185 Greenwich, 388 Greenwich.
- Still **C6-4** high-intensity commercial; very high assessed values tied to downtown office/civic redevelopment.

**Other areas**
- **Upper West Side/Central Park West**: 200 Central Park West (PARK; cultural facility)
- **Upper Manhattan (Washington Heights)**: 180 Ft Washington Ave (hospital; R8 but institutional landuse)
- **Roosevelt Island**: Main Street (R7-2 residential)

### Relationship between location and property type/value
- The **highest concentration** of top assessed lots is in **Midtown’s C5/C6 districts**, aligning with **office towers and mixed commercial**.
- **Non-Midtown** high values tend to be **institutional megasites** (Javits, hospitals, museums) or **major downtown redevelopment** parcels.
- Residential-dominant high assessments appear, but are fewer in this top slice compared with office/commercial.

If you want this as a reproducible workflow, I can provide:
- a tidy table with (zonedist1 counts, decade bins, area-share vectors, floor plate, coverage ratio, neighborhood bucket),
- plus charts (bar for zoning, boxplots for decade vs assesstot, scatter numfloors vs bldgarea with class colors).
