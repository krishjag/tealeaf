## 6. FINANCIAL RECEIVABLES ANALYSIS

From receivables data:

| Financial Metric | Amount |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Total Amount Due (Original)** | $761.00 |
| **Amount Paid** | $352.00 |
| **Adjustments** | $0.00 |
| **Remaining Balance** | $0.00 |

### Collection Analysis:
- **Percentage Paid:** 352/761 = **46.3%**
- **Status:** Document Collected = TRUE, Balance Due = $0

**Note:** Despite only $352 being paid on a $761 obligation, the balance shows $0. This discrepancy suggests the remaining $409 was likely:
  - Written off after conviction reversal
  - Satisfied through other means
  - Adjusted after case dismissal on appeal

The case-level balance also shows $0.00, confirming no outstanding financial obligations.

## 7. BOND ANALYSIS

### Bond Amount: **$5,000.00**

### Bond-Related Docket Entries:

| Date | Entry Description | Amount |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| **2016-02-11** | Signature bond set (Initial appearance) | $5,000 |
| **2016-02-11** | "with felony conds." - Bond conditions specified | $5,000 |
| **2016-02-25** | Signature bond signed and filed | $5,000 |

### Bond Details:
- **Type:** Signature Bond (Recognizance)
- **Conditions:** Felony conditions imposed
- **Status:** Defendant appeared via video from Waupun Correctional during initial appearance (already in custody on other charges)
- **Bond Continuation:** Bond was continued at arraignment on 10/26/2016

**Note:** The defendant was incarcerated throughout these proceedings (initially at Waupun Correctional, later transferred to Green Bay Correctional, then Wisconsin Secure Program Facility), so the bond was effectively a formality for if/when he was released from his other sentence.
