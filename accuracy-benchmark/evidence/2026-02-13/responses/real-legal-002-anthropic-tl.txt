## 1. CHARGE PROGRESSION ANALYSIS

### Original Charges (Information Filed 2016-08-10):
1. **Battery by Prisoners** - §940.20(1) - Felony H
2. **Disorderly Conduct** - §947.01(1) - Misdemeanor B

### Final Charges (After Jury Trial Conviction 2019-12-04):
1. **Battery by Prisoners** - §940.20(1) - Felony H
   - **Modifier 1:** §939.62(1)(b) - **Repeater** (habitual criminality enhancer)
   - **Modifier 2:** §939.63(1)(b) - **Use of a Dangerous Weapon** (penalty enhancer)
   
2. **Disorderly Conduct** - §947.01(1) - Misdemeanor B
   - **Modifier 1:** §939.62(1)(a) - **Repeater** (habitual criminality enhancer)

### Charge Modifications:
- **No charges were added or dropped** - both original charges resulted in convictions
- **Enhancers Applied:** 
  - Both charges received repeater enhancements (§939.62)
  - Charge 1 received an additional dangerous weapon enhancement (§939.63)
- **Notable:** During trial, jury found defendant guilty of Charge 2 **without** the dangerous weapon enhancer, though it was apparently charged. The docket entry states: "Guilty on count 2, Disorderly Conduct without the use of a dangerous weapon" and the judgment notes "With use of a dangerous weapon enhancer dismissed."

- **Relationship:** CONSECUTIVE to any other sentence currently serving
- **Extended Supervision:** 3 years
- **ES Relationship:** CONSECUTIVE to any other sentence currently serving

**Conditions:**
1. **DNA Sample:** Required to submit DNA sample
2. **No Contact:** No contact with the victim of this case
3. **Costs:** $518.00
4. **Civil Judgment Provision:** "If probation is revoked or will discharge with outstanding financial obligations due, a civil judgment shall be entered for the balance due."

### CHARGE 2: Disorderly Conduct (Misdemeanor B)

**Confinement:**
- **Initial Confinement:** 1 year state prison
- **Relationship:** CONCURRENT with Count 1

2. **Costs:** $243.00

### TOTAL SENTENCE STRUCTURE:
- **Actual Prison Time:** 12 years (Charge 2 runs concurrent, adds no additional time)
- **Extended Supervision:** 3 years (Charge 2 runs concurrent, adds no additional time)
- **Total Controlling Sentence:** **15 years** (12 IC + 3 ES)
- **Total Costs:** $761.00 ($518 + $243)

- **Practical Effect:** Charge 2 added no additional incarceration time but did add financial costs

### PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY:
Per sentencing hearing notes: "Defendant is not eligible for the challenge incarceration program or substance abuse program."

### NO JAIL CREDIT:
Defendant received **zero days** of credit for time served, likely because he was already incarcerated on other charges.

## 5. HABEAS CORPUS ANALYSIS

### TOTAL WRITS IDENTIFIED: **18 Writs of Habeas Corpus**

| Date Filed | Court Appearance Date | Institution | Purpose |
|------------|----------------------|-------------|---------|
| Feb 16, 2016 | Feb 25, 2016 | Waupun Correctional | Preliminary hearing |
| Feb 16, 2016 | Feb 18, 2016 | Waupun Correctional | Preliminary hearing (rescheduled) |
| Feb 24, 2016 | March 3, 2016 | Waupun Correctional | Preliminary hearing |
| March 14, 2016 | May 10, 2016 | Waupun Correctional | Return date |
| June 8, 2016 | July 20, 2016 | (Institution not specified) | Return date |
| July 22, 2016 | August 4, 2016 | Green Bay Correctional | Preliminary hearing |
| Aug 10, 2016 | Oct 24, 2016 | (Institution not specified) | Arraignment |
| Aug 17, 2016 | Oct 26, 2016 | (Institution not specified) | Arraignment (corrected) |
| Feb 22, 2018 | April 4, 2018 | (Institution not specified) | Jury trial |
| Dec 2, 2019 | Dec 3, 2019 | (Institution not specified) | Jury trial |
| Dec 17, 2019 | Feb 24, 2020 | (Institution not specified) | Sentencing |
| Feb 17, 2020 | Feb 24, 2020 | Green Bay Correctional | Sentencing (supplemental) |
| Aug 16, 2021 | Sept 10, 2021 | Green Bay Correctional | Evidentiary hearing |
| Aug 16, 2021 | Sept 10, 2021 | Wisconsin Secure Program | Evidentiary hearing (alternate location) |
| Aug 17, 2021 | Sept 10, 2021 | Wisconsin Secure Program | (Duplicate/confirmed) |
| Aug 17, 2021 | Sept 10, 2021 | Green Bay Correctional | (Duplicate/confirmed) |
| Oct 27, 2021 | Nov 29, 2021 | Green Bay Correctional | Evidentiary hearing |
| Nov 2, 2021 | Nov 29, 2021 | Green Bay Correctional | (Confirmed) |

### PATTERN ANALYSIS:

**Frequency by Phase:**
- **Pre-trial phase (2016):** 8 writs (44%)
- **Trial phase (2018-2019):** 2 writs (11%)
- **Sentencing phase (2020):** 2 writs (11%)
- **Post-conviction phase (2021):** 6 writs (33%)

**Institutional Movement:**
1. Waupun Correctional Institution (early 2016)
2. Green Bay Correctional Institution (mid-2016 through 2021)
3. Wisconsin Secure Program Facility (2021 onward - maximum security)

### WHAT THIS PATTERN SUGGESTS:

1. **Defendant was continuously incarcerated** throughout the entire case on other charges (address records show only correctional facilities)

2. **Logistics of prison litigation:** Every court appearance required a writ of habeas corpus to transport defendant from prison, demonstrating the procedural burden of prosecuting incarcerated defendants

3. **Inter-institutional transfers:** The need for duplicate writs to different facilities (e.g., both Green Bay and Wisconsin Secure Program on same date) suggests uncertainty about defendant's location or transfers in progress

4. **Escalating security:** Transfer from Waupun → Green Bay → Wisconsin Secure Program Facility suggests increasing security classification

5. **Post-conviction litigation burden:** One-third of all writs occurred during the evidentiary hearing phase (2021), showing the logistical complexity of post-conviction proceedings

6. **Pattern consistency with defendant status:** The continuous need for writs over 5+ years confirms defendant never posted the $5,000 signature bond and remained in custody throughout

## 6. MOTION ACTIVITY ANALYSIS

### MOTION INVENTORY BY TYPE:

#### **DISCOVERY MOTIONS (Early Phase)**
- **March 15, 2016:** Demand for discovery + Petition for Leave to File Additional Motions (Defense)
- **March 28, 2016:** Motion and demand for discovery + Notice of DNA and Witness List (State)

#### **CONTINUANCE/SCHEDULING MOTIONS (Pre-Trial Phase)**

#### **SUBSTANTIVE PRE-TRIAL MOTIONS**
- **April 15, 2019:** Motion to Dismiss (Defense - **DENIED** June 17, 2019)
- **September 26, 2018:** Demand for Speedy Trial (Defense)

#### **POST-CONVICTION MOTIONS (Most Active Phase)**
- **June 21, 2021:** Defendant's Postconviction Motion to Vacate Conviction and Dismiss Case for Speedy Trial Violation
- **October 28, 2022:** Defendant's Supplemental Postconviction Motion/Motion to Reconsider Denial of Postconviction Motion

- **March 11, 2022:** Fourth Motion to Extend Time for Circuit Court Decision (Granted)
- **January 9, 2023:** Motion to Extend Time for Circuit Court to Issue Order Determining Supplemental Motion (Granted)

### MOTION FREQUENCY BY PHASE:

| Phase | Motion Count | Percentage | Dominant Motion Type |
|-------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| Pre-Trial (2016-2019) | 8 | 23% | Discovery, Continuances, Motions in Limine |
| Trial (2019) | 2 | 6% | Trial motions (dismissed, speedy trial) |
| Post-Conviction (2020-2023) | 14 | 40% | **Extensions + Substantive relief motions** |
| Appellate (2022-2025) | 11 | 31% | Extensions for briefing/decisions |
| **TOTAL** | **35 motions** | 100% | |

### HIGHEST MOTION ACTIVITY: POST-CONVICTION PHASE (2020-2023)

**Why this phase had the most motion activity:**

1. **Procedural Complexity:** Post-conviction relief requires multiple procedural steps (appointing counsel, ordering transcripts, extending deadlines)

2. **Extension Pattern:** **10 motions** were purely for time extensions, showing:
   - Defense needed time to review extensive record (3 years of pre-trial, 2-day trial)
   - Multiple transcripts had to be prepared (8+ hearings transcribed)
   - Court of Appeals granted multiple extensions for circuit court to decide motions

3. **Substantive Litigation:** 2 major substantive motions (speedy trial violation) required:
   - Evidentiary hearing (November 29, 2021)
   - Supplemental briefing
   - Second motion to reconsider

4. **Appellate Remand:** Court of Appeals remanded case back to circuit court in September 2022, requiring supplemental post-conviction motion and additional briefing cycle

### MOTION SUCCESS RATE:

**Procedural Motions (Extensions/Continuances):** ~100% success rate (all granted)

**Substantive Motions:**
- Motion to Dismiss (2019): **DENIED**
- Postconviction Motion (2022): **DENIED**
- Supplemental Motion/Motion to Reconsider (2023): **DENIED**
- **BUT:** Appeal of denial ultimately **SUCCESSFUL** (conviction reversed 2024)

### KEY OBSERVATION:
The defendant **lost every substantive motion at the circuit court level** but ultimately prevailed on appeal, suggesting the circuit court was resistant to the speedy trial claim but the Court of Appeals found merit in it.

## **FINAL OUTCOME:**

After **10 years, 4 months, and 27 days** of litigation:

✅ **Conviction VACATED**  
✅ **Case DISMISSED**  
✅ **Defendant prevails on speedy trial claim**  

The defendant, who was found guilty by jury and sentenced to 15 years in prison, ultimately had his conviction reversed on **constitutional speedy trial grounds** - despite the circuit court denying his speedy trial motion **three times** (2019, 2022, 2023).

---

## **MOST SIGNIFICANT PROCEDURAL EVENTS:**

1. **September 26, 2018** - Demand for Speedy Trial filed (planted seed for eventual victory)
2. **June 17, 2019** - Motion to Dismiss denied (circuit court rejects speedy trial claim)
3. **December 4, 2019** - Jury verdict (guilty on both counts after 47-minute deliberation)
4. **February 24, 2020** - 15-year sentence imposed
5. **September 7, 2022** - Court of Appeals takes unprecedented step of remanding before briefing complete
6. **April 25, 2024** - Court of Appeals reverses conviction (vindication after 9+ years)
7. **September 5, 2025** - Remittitur issued (final victory)

---

## **KEY INSIGHTS:**

**Speedy Trial Violation:** The 3+ year delay between arraignment (Oct 2016) and trial (Dec 2019), combined with the defendant's explicit demand (Sept 2018), ultimately proved fatal to the prosecution despite a jury conviction.

**Persistent Defense:** Defense counsel filed motions at every opportunity and never waived the speedy trial claim, demonstrating effective appellate advocacy.

**Incarcerated Throughout:** Defendant never obtained release on bond and remained in DOC custody at three different institutions over 10 years.

**Appellate Vindication:** The case exemplifies how constitutional violations can overturn even solid jury verdicts - the defendant lost at every stage in circuit court but ultimately prevailed on appeal.
