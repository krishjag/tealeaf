## 1) Charge progression (chargeHistory → final charges)

### Original charges (chargeHistory)
Both charges appear at the complaint stage and are later “replaced by: Information Filed” (i.e., same charges carried forward into the Information rather than being replaced by different counts):

1. **Count 1**: Battery by Prisoners — **Wis. Stat. § 940.20(1)** — **Felony H**
2. **Count 2**: Disorderly Conduct — **Wis. Stat. § 947.01(1)** — **Misd. B**

### Final charges at disposition (jury verdict / JOC)
The final “charges” list matches the original two counts (no new counts added; none dropped as standalone counts):

1. **Count 1**: Battery by Prisoners, **Found Guilty at Jury Trial**
2. **Count 2**: Disorderly Conduct, **Found Guilty at Jury Trial**

### Modifiers / enhancers applied (and what happened to them)
**Count 1 modifiers (both remained and were part of the guilty verdict):**
- **Repeater** — **§ 939.62(1)(b)**
- **Use of a Dangerous Weapon** — **§ 939.63(1)(b)**

**Count 2 modifiers:**
- **Repeater** — **§ 939.62(1)(a)** (remained)
- The judgment text for Count 2 includes: **“With use of a dangerous weapon enhancer dismissed.”**  
  This indicates a **weapon enhancer was litigated/charged at some point for Count 2**, but **was dismissed** by the time of conviction/sentencing (and the jury verdict narrative also reflects guilt on Count 2 **without** the weapon enhancer).

**Bottom line on progression:** same two base charges from start to finish; the meaningful modification is that **the dangerous-weapon enhancer applied to Count 1 but was dismissed/not applied to Count 2**.

## 3) Appellate trajectory: Court of Appeals + Supreme Court entries (chronological)

### Court of Appeals-related entries (as reflected in circuit docket)
(These are the circuit-court docket notations documenting appellate actions.)

**2020 (postconviction deadline management / transcript issues)**
- **2020-06-15** — Order of Court of Appeals (deadline to appoint counsel/order transcripts extended)
- **2020-10-27** — Order of Court of Appeals (extend time to file postconviction motion/NOA to 12/21/20)
- **2020-12-23** — Order of Court of Appeals (extend to 2/19/21)

**2021 (more extensions; then postconviction motion filed)**
- **2021-02-22** — Order of Court of Appeals (extend to 4/20/21)
- **2021-04-21** — Order of Court of Appeals (extend to 6/21/21)
- **2021-10-19** — Order of Court of Appeals (extend time for circuit court to decide postconviction motion to 12/20/21)
- **2021-12-14** — Order of Court of Appeals (extend to 3/14/22)

**2022 (extensions; appeal initiated; remand order)**
- **2022-03-14** — Order of Court of Appeals (extend circuit decision deadline to 5/31/22)
- **2022-06-07** — Acknowledgment from Court of Appeals (NOA received)
- **2022-07-11 / 2022-07-15** — Transmittal of record to Court of Appeals (index/record transmissions)
- **2022-09-07** — Order of Court of Appeals (entry exists; details not shown)
- **2022-09-30** — **Order of Court of Appeals remanding** for supplemental postconviction motion; COA retains jurisdiction

**2023 (remand extensions; record transmissions)**
- **2023-01-10** — Order of Court of Appeals (extend circuit court deadline on remand to 5/22/23)
- **2023-01-26** — Acknowledgment from Court of Appeals (record filed)
- **2023-02-07** — Order of Court of Appeals (entry exists; details not shown)
- **2023-06-01** — Order of Court of Appeals (extend briefing deadline)
- **2023-06-26** — Order of Court of Appeals (transmittal of record due); acknowledgment supplemental record filed

**2024 (merits decision)**
- **2024-04-25** — **Court of Appeals decision & order reversing**:  
  “Reverse the Judgment of Conviction and Circuit Court Orders Denying Postconviction Motions and remand for the Circuit Court to Dismiss the Complaint.”

### Supreme Court-related entries
- **2024-05-28** — Acknowledgment from Supreme Court (“for Review - Supreme Court”)
- **2024-10-07** — Order of the Supreme Court (entry exists; details not shown)
- **2024-11-11** — Supreme Court order: State’s opening brief due **12/06/2024**
- **2025-01-03** — Supreme Court order: defendant’s brief accepted for filing
- **2025-06-27** — **Supreme Court decision filed** (“Review of Decision of the Court of Appeals/Supreme Court decision”)
- **2025-09-05** — **Remittitur** (petition for review case)

**Trajectory and outcome (from what is visible here):**
- COA ultimately **reversed the conviction and postconviction denials** and ordered remand to **dismiss the complaint** (a very strong remedy, consistent with a successful speedy-trial-type claim or similar structural error).
- The case then went to the **Wisconsin Supreme Court on review**, which issued a decision on **2025-06-27**. The docket text provided does **not** state whether the Supreme Court affirmed or reversed the COA; it only indicates a decision was filed. (To determine the final statewide outcome, you’d need the Supreme Court decision’s disposition language.)

## 4) Sentencing structure and supervision conditions (Counts 1 and 2)

### Count 1 (Battery by Prisoners; repeater + dangerous weapon)
- **Initial confinement (State Prison):** **12 years**
  - **Consecutive to:** “Any other sentence currently serving.”
- **Extended supervision:** **3 years**
  - **Consecutive to:** “Any other sentence currently serving.”
- **Conditions listed under ES (Count 1):**
  - **Costs** (with civil judgment language if unpaid at discharge/revocation)
  - **Other:** **Submit DNA sample**; **No contact with the victim**

### Count 2 (Disorderly Conduct; repeater; weapon enhancer dismissed)
- **Initial confinement (State Prison):** **1 year**
  - **Concurrent with:** Count 1
- **Extended supervision:** **6 months**
  - **Concurrent with:** Count 1
- **Conditions listed under ES (Count 2):**
  - **Costs:** “Same conditions as Ct. 1.”

### How they differ
- **Consecutive vs concurrent:** Count 1 is explicitly **consecutive to any other sentence currently serving**; Count 2 is **concurrent with Count 1**.
- **Length:** Count 1 is the controlling sentence (12 IC + 3 ES). Count 2 is shorter (1 IC + 6 months ES).
- **Condition specificity:** Count 1 explicitly lists **DNA submission** and **no-contact**; Count 2 incorporates conditions by reference (“same as Ct. 1”) for costs, and the sentencing-hearing narrative also reiterates **no contact**.

## 5) Habeas corpus activity (counts and interpretation)

### Count of “Writ of Habeas Corpus” / “Petition for writ of habeas corpus” entries
From the docket entries provided, the case shows **repeated transport writ practice** (common when the defendant is incarcerated in DOC and must be produced for hearings). Counting both “Writ of Habeas Corpus” and “Petition for writ of habeas corpus” entries visible:

- **2016:** 6 entries (2/16 x2; 2/24; 3/14; 6/8; 7/22)
- **2018:** 6 entries (2/22 x2 petitions + 2 proposed orders; 2/23 x2 writs)
- **2019:** 4 entries (12/02 writ + petition + proposed order; 12/17 petition; 12/18 writ)
- **2020:** 1 entry (2/17 petition)
- **2021:** 6 entries (8/16 petitions x2 + proposed orders; 8/17 writs x2; 10/27 petition; 11/02 writ)

**Total visible habeas-related entries:** **~23** (depending on whether you count proposed orders separately; the above count excludes “Proposed Order” unless paired in the narrative list and focuses on writ/petition lines).

### What the pattern suggests
This pattern looks far more like **routine production/transport writs** for an incarcerated defendant across many hearings (prelim, trial, sentencing, evidentiary hearings) than like substantive habeas litigation challenging custody. It suggests:
- The defendant was continuously in DOC custody in multiple institutions (Waupun, Green Bay, WSPF), requiring repeated writs.
- Postconviction activity (2021 evidentiary hearings) also required production, hence another cluster.

## 6) Motions pattern (types and when motion activity peaks)

### Motion types that appear most often (by docket labels)
- **Motions to extend time** (filed in Court of Appeals) — repeated 2020–2023
- **Postconviction motions**:
  - Motion to vacate conviction/dismiss for **speedy trial violation** (2021-06-21)
  - Supplemental postconviction motion / **motion to reconsider** (2022-10-28)
- **Pretrial/trial motions**:
  - Motions in limine / additional motions in limine (2019-03-26)
  - Motion to dismiss (2019-04-15; litigated 2019-06-17)
  - Motion for continuance (2018-03-06)

### Phase with highest motion activity
- **Postconviction / appellate phase (2020–2023)** has the densest motion activity, largely driven by:
  - repeated **extension motions/orders**
  - the main postconviction motion and supplemental motion practice
- A secondary peak occurs in **2019 pretrial** (motions in limine + motion to dismiss).
