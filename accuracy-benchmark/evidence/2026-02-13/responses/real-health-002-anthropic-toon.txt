## 7. Highest Average Prevalence Measures by Category

| Category | Measure | Average Across 10 Counties | Description |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **HLTHOUT** | High Cholesterol | **35.84%** | Among adults ever screened |
| **HLTHSTAT** | Fair/Poor General Health | **18.30%** | Self-rated health status |

| **RISKBEH** | Short Sleep Duration | **31.51%** | <7 hours sleep |
| **DISABLT** | Any Disability | **29.90%** | At least one disability type |

### Key Insights:

1. **Health Outcomes:** High cholesterol affects more than 1 in 3 adults statewide, making it the most prevalent chronic condition measured.

2. **Health Status:** Nearly 1 in 5 adults report fair or poor health, with Yakima (26.4%) and Ferry (24.3%) showing particularly concerning rates.

3. **Prevention:** Cholesterol screening shows high uptake (>83%), but significant gaps remain in dental visits (64.87% average) and colorectal cancer screening (65.98% average).

4. **Risk Behaviors:** Short sleep duration (31.51%) is the most prevalent risk behavior, followed by physical inactivity (19.82%).

5. **Disability:** Nearly 30% of adults report at least one disability, with Ferry County at 38.7% — indicating substantial functional limitations in rural populations.

## Summary of Disparities

**Urban-Rural Divide:** Small rural counties (Ferry, Garfield, Island) consistently show:
- Higher chronic disease burden
- Greater disability prevalence  
- More barriers to preventive care

**King County Advantage:** The state's largest urban center shows the lowest rates across most negative health indicators, suggesting better access to healthcare, healthier behaviors, and possibly demographic differences.

**Prevention Gaps:** Despite high cholesterol screening rates, obesity and related chronic conditions remain prevalent, suggesting opportunities for improved lifestyle intervention programs statewide.
