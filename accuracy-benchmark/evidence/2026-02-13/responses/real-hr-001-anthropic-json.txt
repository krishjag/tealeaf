## 7. Private Sector vs. Government Comparison

| **Average Quit Rate** | 2.22% | 0.76% | **Private (2.9x higher)** |
| **Average Layoff Rate** | 1.22% | 0.33% | **Private (3.7x higher)** |

**Key Finding**: The private sector has significantly higher rates across all three metrics. This reflects:
- **Hires**: More dynamic labor market with faster hiring
- **Quits**: More job mobility and voluntary turnover
- **Layoffs**: More exposure to business cycles and market conditions

Government employment is much more stable with lower turnover in both directions (voluntary and involuntary).
