## 6. Population-Weighted Obesity Average

**Calculation:** (Sum of obesity_rate × adult_population) / Total adult population

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Weighted Obesity Rate** | **29.70%** |
| Total Adult Population | 4,004,711 |

**Context:** This weighted average (29.70%) is significantly influenced by King County's large population (45.9% of state adults analyzed) with its lower obesity rate (22.6%). Simple average would be 33.44%.
