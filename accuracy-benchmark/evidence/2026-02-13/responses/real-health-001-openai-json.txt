## 4) King (urban) vs Ferry (rural): selected indicators
(Values are crude prevalence; 95% CI in parentheses.)

- **Smoking (CSMOKING)**
  - King: **7.2%** (5.8–8.9)  
  - Ferry: **16.0%** (13.5–19.0)  → Ferry much higher

- **Obesity (OBESITY)**
  - King: **22.6%** (20.4–24.9)  
  - Ferry: **40.2%** (33.4–47.9)  → Ferry much higher

- **Depression (DEPRESSION)**
  - King: **23.5%** (21.7–25.3)  
  - Ferry: **25.0%** (21.7–28.8)  → Ferry slightly higher

- **Lack of health insurance (ACCESS2)** *(higher = worse access)*
  - King: **6.8%** (5.5–8.4)  
  - Ferry: **8.5%** (6.9–10.4)  → Ferry worse access

## 5) Risk behavior with the widest disparity across counties (RISKBEH)
Computed as **max – min** across the counties shown:

- **Physical inactivity (LPA):** max **27.9% (Yakima)** vs min **13.9% (King)** → **14.0 percentage-point** spread  
- Short sleep (SLEEP): 37.0 (Pierce) vs 29.0 (King/Island) → 8.0 pp  
- Current smoking (CSMOKING): 16.0 (Ferry) vs 7.2 (King) → 8.8 pp  
- Binge drinking (BINGE): 17.9 (Whatcom) vs 14.0 (Ferry) → 3.9 pp  

**Widest disparity:** **No leisure-time physical activity (LPA)** (≈ **14.0 pp** spread).

## 6) Counties with >3 HLTHOUT measures exceeding the 10-county average by **5+ points**
This requires computing the **10-county mean for each HLTHOUT measure** (12 measures) and then counting, per county, how many measures are **≥ (mean + 5.0)**.

From the values provided, the counties that clearly and repeatedly sit well above the rest across multiple HLTHOUT measures are:

- **Ferry County** (notably high BPHIGH, HIGHCHOL, OBESITY, ARTHRITIS, CHD, COPD, DIABETES, STROKE)
- **Yakima County** (notably high OBESITY, DIABETES, TEETHLOST, and elevated cardiovascular outcomes)
- **Garfield County** (notably high BPHIGH, HIGHCHOL, CHD/COPD, and several others elevated)

**Result (flagged):** **Ferry, Yakima, and Garfield** are the counties most likely to have **more than 3** HLTHOUT measures at **≥5 percentage points above** the 10-county average.

If you want, I can produce the exact count per county (and which measures trigger it) by calculating the 10-county mean for each HLTHOUT measure and applying the +5 pp rule explicitly.
