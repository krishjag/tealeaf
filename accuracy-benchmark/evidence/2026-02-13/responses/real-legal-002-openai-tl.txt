## 1) Charge progression (original vs. final; adds/drops/modifications; enhancers)

### Original charges (ChargeHistory; “Information Filed”)
Both counts appear in the charge history exactly as ultimately tried/convicted—no additional counts are shown as added later, and none are shown as dismissed outright.

- **Count 1 (Felony H)**: *Battery by Prisoners* — **Wis. Stat. § 940.20(1)**
- **Count 2 (Misd. B)**: *Disorderly Conduct* — **Wis. Stat. § 947.01(1)**

ChargeHistory entries are both labeled “Information Filed,” and there are no “replaced by” entries indicating amended/replaced counts.

### Final charges (as disposed)
The final charges match the original two counts; disposition is by **jury trial guilty verdicts** on both counts.

- **Ct. 1**: Battery by Prisoners, **Found Guilty at Jury Trial**
- **Ct. 2**: Disorderly Conduct, **Found Guilty at Jury Trial**  
  - Judgment note indicates: **“With use of a dangerous weapon enhancer dismissed.”** (see below)

### Modifiers / enhancers applied (and statutes referenced)
**Count 1 modifiers (both applied):**
- **Repeater** — **§ 939.62(1)(b)**
- **Use of a Dangerous Weapon** — **§ 939.63(1)(b)**

**Count 2 modifiers (charged, but weapon enhancer dismissed):**
- **Repeater** — **§ 939.62(1)(a)**
- A weapon enhancer appears to have been in play at trial charging/instructions, but the judgment explicitly states: **weapon enhancer dismissed on Ct. 2**.

**Bottom line:** No counts added/dropped in the dataset; the key modification is that **Ct. 2’s dangerous-weapon enhancer was dismissed**, while Ct. 1 retained both repeater and weapon enhancers.

## 3) Appellate trajectory: Court of Appeals + Supreme Court entries (chronological) and outcome

### Court of Appeals-related entries (chronological)
- **2020-06-11** Motion to extend time for appointing postconviction counsel/ordering transcripts (filed by appellate attorney)
- **2020-06-15** COA order extending SPD deadline (through May 20, 2020)
- **2020-10-27** COA order extending time to file postconviction motion/NOA (to 12/21/2020)
- **2020-12-23** COA order extending time (to 2/19/2021)
- **2021-02-22** COA order extending time (to 4/20/2021)
- **2021-04-21** COA order extending time (to 6/21/2021)

(After the postconviction motion is filed and litigated, COA entries shift to “time to decide” extensions and then the appeal itself.)

- **2021-10-19** COA order extending time for circuit court to decide postconviction motion (to 12/20/2021)
- **2021-12-14** COA order extending time (to 3/14/2022)
- **2022-03-14** COA order extending time (to 5/31/2022)

**Appeal initiated**
- **2022-06-07** Acknowledgment from COA (NOA and docket entries received)
- **2022-07-11 / 2022-07-15** Transmittal(s) of record / index activity
- **2022-09-30** **COA order retaining jurisdiction and remanding** for supplemental postconviction motion (deadline set; briefing extended relative to return of record)

**Remand proceedings then return**
- **2023-01-10** COA order extending time for circuit court to decide pending supplemental motion (to 5/22/2023)
- **2023-06-01** COA order extending time to file appellant’s brief
- **2023-06-26** COA order re transmittal of record; acknowledgment of supplemental record filed

**Merits decision**
- **2024-04-25** **Court of Appeals decision & order reversing**:  
  “Reverse the Judgment of Conviction and Circuit Court Orders Denying Postconviction Motions and remand for the Circuit Court to Dismiss the Complaint.”

### Supreme Court-related entries (chronological)
- **2024-05-28** Acknowledgment from Supreme Court (“for Review - Supreme Court”)
- **2024-10-07** Order of the Supreme Court (entry exists; text not shown)
- **2024-11-11** Supreme Court order granting motion; State’s opening brief due **12/06/2024**
- **2025-01-03** Supreme Court order accepting defendant/appellant/respondent brief for filing
- **2025-06-27** **Supreme Court decision filed** (“Review of Decision of the Court of Appeals/Supreme Court decision”)
- **2025-09-05** **Remittitur** (petition for review case)

### Trajectory and outcome (as reflected in circuit docket text)
- COA ultimately **reversed** and ordered **remand with directions to dismiss the complaint** (strong relief; not just a new trial).
- Supreme Court then took up review and issued a decision (content not included in the dataset text). The presence of remittitur indicates the Supreme Court proceeding concluded and jurisdiction returned.  
  **However, the circuit docket does not state in plain text whether the Supreme Court affirmed or reversed the COA reversal**—only that a Supreme Court decision was filed.

## 4) Sentencing structure and supervision conditions (Ct. 1 vs Ct. 2)

### Count 1 (Battery by Prisoners; Felony H; repeater + weapon)
**Sentence (imposed 2020-02-24; judgment order date 2019-12-04):**
- **Initial confinement (State Prison):** **12 years**
  - **Consecutive to:** “Any other sentence currently serving.”
- **Extended supervision:** **3 years**
  - **Consecutive to:** “Any other sentence currently serving.”

**Conditions listed under Ct. 1 ES:**
- **Costs**: note about civil judgment if revoked/discharged with unpaid obligations.
- **Other**:
  - **Submit DNA sample**
  - **No contact with the victim of this case**

### Count 2 (Disorderly Conduct; Misd. B; repeater; weapon enhancer dismissed)
**Sentence:**
- **Initial confinement (State Prison):** **1 year**
  - **Concurrent with:** Ct. 1
- **Extended supervision:** **6 months**
  - **Concurrent with:** Ct. 1

**Conditions listed under Ct. 2 ES:**
- **Costs**: “Same conditions as Ct. 1.”

### How they differ
- **Structure:** Ct. 1 is the controlling sentence (15 years bifurcated: 12 IC + 3 ES) and is **consecutive to any other sentence**; Ct. 2 is **fully concurrent** with Ct. 1.
- **Conditions:** Ct. 1 explicitly lists **DNA submission** and **no-contact** (and costs language). Ct. 2’s conditions are incorporated by reference (“same conditions as Ct. 1”), rather than restated.

## 5) Habeas corpus activity: count and what the pattern suggests

### Count of writ-related docket entries (as recorded)
Counting docket entries whose description is **“Writ of Habeas Corpus”** (not merely “petition” or “proposed order”):

1. **2016-02-16** Writ of Habeas Corpus (for 2/25/16)
2. **2016-02-16** Writ of Habeas Corpus (for 2/18/16)
3. **2016-02-24** Writ of Habeas Corpus (for 3/3/16)
4. **2016-03-14** Writ of Habeas Corpus (for 5/10/16)
5. **2016-06-08** Writ of Habeas Corpus (for 7/20/16)
6. **2016-07-22** Writ of Habeas Corpus
7. **2018-02-23** Writ of Habeas Corpus
8. **2018-02-23** Writ of Habeas Corpus
9. **2019-12-02** Writ of Habeas Corpus
10. **2019-12-18** Writ of Habeas Corpus (for sentencing)
11. **2021-08-17** Writ of Habeas Corpus (WSPF for 9/10/21)
12. **2021-08-17** Writ of Habeas Corpus (Green Bay CI for 9/10/21)
13. **2021-11-02** Writ of Habeas Corpus (for 11/29/21)

**Total “Writ of Habeas Corpus” entries: 13.**

There are also numerous **petitions** and **proposed orders** associated with these writs (often filed by the DA), which indicates repeated transport/production orders for an incarcerated defendant to appear (in person or by video).

### What the pattern suggests
This pattern looks less like “habeas” as a postconviction remedy and more like **routine custodial-production writ practice** in Wisconsin criminal cases when a defendant is already in DOC custody at different institutions. The writs cluster around **scheduled hearings/trial/sentencing/postconviction evidentiary hearings**, consistent with ensuring the defendant’s presence.

---

## 6) Motions pattern: types and when motion activity was highest

### Motion types appearing
- **Continuance** (explicit “Motion for Continuance” 2018-03-06; plus multiple reset requests via letters)
- **Motions in limine / additional motions in limine** (2019-03-26)
- **Motion to dismiss** (filed by defendant 2019-04-15; litigated 2019-06-17; denied)
- **Postconviction motion to vacate/dismiss for speedy trial violation** (2021-06-21)
- **Supplemental postconviction motion / motion to reconsider** (2022-10-28)
- Numerous **motions to extend time** (primarily in the Court of Appeals context: appoint counsel/order transcripts; file postconviction motion/NOA; extend time for circuit court to decide)

### Phase with highest motion activity
By volume, the **postconviction/appeal phase (2020–2023)** shows the densest motion activity because of:
- repeated **extension motions** and orders,
- the main postconviction motion,
- supplemental motion/remand motion practice.

By “substantive trial-court motions” (not extensions), the **pretrial period in 2018–2019** is the peak (continuance, in limine practice, dismissal motion).

If you want, I can also (a) compute exact day-counts between each major milestone, and/or (b) tabulate every trial-date reset and attribute it (State vs defense vs court logistics) based on the docket text.
