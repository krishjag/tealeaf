I can analyze (1)–(7), but the payload you provided is truncated: I only see **~24 of the 30** properties (it cuts off at “250 WEST 34 STREET”). So the counts/averages below are **for the visible records only** and should be treated as *partial*; the missing 6 lots could change rankings and decade averages.

## 1) Zoning district distribution (zonedist1) + what it permits; M vs C vs R

### Frequency (visible records)
Most common `zonedist1` values among the high-assessment lots shown:

- **C6-4**: **7** (185 Greenwich; 500 W 33; 427 10 Ave; 527 W 34; 388 Greenwich; 250 W 34; plus C6-4 appears as split/paired in some but counted here by zonedist1)
- **C5-2.5**: **7** (1250 AoA; 1290 AoA; 345 Park; 1260 AoA; 9 W 57; 666 5 Ave; 1260/others)
- **C5-3**: **4** (761 5 Ave; 338 5 Ave; 51 E 42; plus some are split with C5-3 but zonedist1 differs)
- **C6-6**: **3** (1 Columbus Circle; 1111 AoA; 601 Lex)
- Other singletons: **M2-3 (1)**, **M1-5 (1)**, **R7-2 (3)**, **R8 (1)**, **PARK (1)**, **C6-5.5 (2)**, **C6-6.5 (1)**, **C6-7 (1)**, **C5-2 (1)**

### What the zoning implies (high-level)
- **C5 / C6 districts (Commercial)** dominate: these are Manhattan’s high-density commercial districts permitting large office towers, hotels, and mixed commercial uses; FAR allowances are typically high and often paired with special districts (e.g., **MiD** Midtown, **HY** Hudson Yards).
- **R7-2 / R8 (Residential)**: medium-to-high density residential districts (often with contextual or inclusionary overlays). In this dataset they correspond to very large residential complexes/institutional uses.
- **M1-5 / M2-3 (Manufacturing)**: industrial/manufacturing districts. In Manhattan, these often host large commercial conversions (tech/office) or major facilities; M2 is heavier industrial than M1.
- **PARK**: mapped parkland/special designation (here: a major cultural facility).

### Identify M vs C vs R (visible records)
**Manufacturing (M) zonedist1**
- **360 WEST STREET** (M2-3) — bldgclass **P9** (public facility), convention center
- **111 8 AVENUE** (M1-5) — bldgclass **O6**, office

**Residential (R) zonedist1**
- **240 1 AVENUE** (R7-2) — bldgclass **D7**, very large residential complex
- **MAIN STREET (Roosevelt Island)** (R7-2) — bldgclass **D4**, large residential/mixed
- **180 FT WASHINGTON AVENUE** (R8) — bldgclass **I1** (institutional), hospital-related

**Commercial (C) zonedist1**
- The remainder are overwhelmingly **C5-2.5 / C5-3 / C6-4 / C6-6 / C6-7 / C6-6.5 / C6-5.5 / C5-2**, i.e., Midtown and Lower Manhattan office/mixed towers.

## 2) Building age profile by decade + assessed value relationship (partial)

I grouped by `yearbuilt` decade and computed **average `assesstot`** for the visible records.

### Counts + average assessed value per decade (visible)
- **1930s (3 properties)**: avg **$501.4M**  
  (1931 Empire State; 1931 111 8 Ave; 1937 1250 AoA)
- **1940s (1)**: avg **$791.8M**  
  (1945 240 1 Ave)
- **1950s (1)**: avg **$449.8M**  
  (1958 666 5 Ave)
- **1960s (5)**: avg **$671.3M**  
  (1961 1271 AoA; 1963 360 West; 1963 1290 AoA; 1963 1290?; 1968 761 5 Ave; 1969 345 Park)
- **1970s (7)**: avg **$490.8M**  
  (1970 1251 AoA; 1971 1221 AoA; 1971 9 W 57; 1972 1631 Bway; 1972 250 W 34; 1973 1211 AoA; 1975 Roosevelt Island)
- **1980s (2)**: avg **$485.9M**  
  (1978 601 Lex; 1989 388 Greenwich)
- **1990s (1)**: avg **$474.4M**  
  (1998 AMNH facility)
- **2000s (2)**: avg **$650.5M**  
  (2004 Time Warner Center condo; 2009 185 Greenwich)
- **2010s (4)**: avg **$626.5M**  
  (2015 500 W 33; 2017 One Vanderbilt; 2018 527 W 34; 2019 427 10 Ave)

### Relationship: newer ≠ always higher, but “new trophy office” is high
- The **single highest** assessment shown is **185 Greenwich (2009)** at **$1.673B** (Lower Manhattan mega-site).
- **2010s Hudson Yards / One Vanderbilt** are very high, but the decade average is pulled down/up depending on whether you include mega-sites.
- Many **1960s–1970s Midtown office towers** still assess very high (often $440M–$790M), so age alone is not determinative; **location + zoning + scale + class** matter more.

## 3) Area composition (% of bldgarea) + mixed-use vs single-purpose

Method (per property):  
- Commercial share = `comarea / bldgarea`  
- Residential share = `resarea / bldgarea`  
- Office share = `officearea / bldgarea`  
- Retail share = `retailarea / bldgarea`  
- “Other” share approximated from `otherarea` (where present) / `bldgarea`  
Note: `comarea` often already *includes* office/retail/other, so office+retail+other can sum to ~comarea.

### Most mixed-use (multiple components materially > 0)
- **1 COLUMBUS CIRCLE (Time Warner Center Condo)**  
  - com ~68.9%, res ~21.0%, office ~37.2%, retail ~19.9%, garage ~5.4%, other ~6.3%  
  Strong true mixed-use (res + office + retail + hotel/other components).
- **240 1 AVENUE** (large residential complex)  
  - res ~93.6%, com ~6.4%, plus retail/office/garage present  
  Predominantly residential but with meaningful ancillary uses.
- **MAIN STREET (Roosevelt Island)**  
  - res ~78.1%, com ~21.9% (retail ~11.2% of total), plus garage/other  
  Mixed residential + retail/community.
- **185 GREENWICH STREET**  
  - office ~79.9%, retail ~9.2%, other ~10.9%  
  Commercial but internally mixed (office + retail + other).
- **1260 AVENUE OF THE AMER**  
  - office ~68.2%, retail ~11.8%, other ~20.0%  
  Not residential, but multi-component commercial program.

### Mostly single-purpose (dominant one use)
Many Midtown **O4** office towers are essentially single-purpose office with small retail:
- **527 W 34**: office ~100%
- **388 Greenwich**: office ~100%
- **111 8 Ave**: office ~100%
- **345 Park**: office ~87.9% (retail ~4.6%, storage ~4.9%)
- **One Vanderbilt (51 E 42)**: office ~97.7%, retail ~2.3%
- **1111 AoA**: office ~97.5%, retail ~2.5%

Public/institutional single-purpose:
- **360 West (Convention Center)**: “other/assembly/storage” dominates; office/retail/res ~0
- **200 Central Park West (AMNH)**: “other” dominates; no res/office/retail

## 4) numfloors vs bldgarea; average floor plate (bldgarea/numfloors) + patterns by class

Average floor plate size = `bldgarea / numfloors` (gross, not net rentable).

Largest floor plates (visible)
- **240 1 AVENUE (D7)**: 8,942,176 / 13 ≈ **687,860 sf/floor** (campus-style superblock; “floors” field not comparable to towers)
- **MAIN STREET Roosevelt Island (D4)**: 4,786,701 / 18 ≈ **265,928 sf/floor**
- **360 WEST STREET (P9)**: 4,060,596 / 4 ≈ **1,015,149 sf/floor** (convention center—huge plates)
- **111 8 AVENUE (O6)**: 2,161,994 / 17 ≈ **127,176 sf/floor**
- **185 GREENWICH (O4)**: 8,966,500 / 104 ≈ **86,216 sf/floor**

Typical Midtown office towers (O4/RC) cluster much lower:
- Many are roughly **30k–55k sf/floor** (e.g., 345 Park ~38.9k; 761 5 Ave ~36.5k; 1111 AoA ~40.8k; 1631 Bway ~50.8k)

Pattern by building class (qualitative)
- **P9 / large facilities** → extremely large floor plates (low-rise, massive footprint).
- **D4/D7 large residential complexes** → very large “per-floor” due to multiple buildings aggregated into one lot record.
- **O4/RC office towers** → moderate plates; taller buildings often have smaller plates, but trophy towers can still have sizable plates (e.g., 1 WTC site at 185 Greenwich).

## 5) Top 5 owners by total assessed value (visible) + concentration

Top owners by `assesstot` (visible records)
1. **LOWER MANHATTAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION** — **$1.673B** (185 Greenwich)
2. **NEW YORK CONVENTION CENTER** — **$931.4M** (360 West)
3. **TIME WARNER CENTER CONDOMINIUM** — **$794.4M**
4. **BPP ST OWNER LLC** — **$791.8M**
5. **767 FIFTH PARTNERS LLC** — **$791.1M**

Concentration (partial view)
- In the visible set, **ownership is not very concentrated**: most owners appear **once**.
- A few “UNAVAILABLE OWNER” entries appear multiple times, but that’s a data-quality placeholder rather than a true owner identity.
- To quantify concentration properly (e.g., top-5 share of total assessed value), I’d need the **full 30** records (and ideally normalize “UNAVAILABLE OWNER”).

## 6) Lot vs building dimensions; lot coverage ratio (bldgfront*bldgdepth / lotarea)

Caveats:
- `bldgfront`/`bldgdepth` are often **0** or not meaningful for multi-building campuses; coverage computed from them can be wrong.
- For towers, `bldgfront*bldgdepth` is a crude rectangle approximation.

Examples (where dimensions look usable)
- **1111 AoA (One Bryant Park)**: (201 * 437) / 87,863 ≈ **~1.00** (near full lot coverage by the rectangle proxy)
- **338 5 AVE (Empire State Building lot)**: (198 * 425) / 91,351 ≈ **0.92**
- **761 5 AVE**: (200.67 * 314.67) / 84,350 ≈ **0.75**
- **1221 AoA**: (192 * 494) / 102,452 ≈ **0.93**
- **345 Park**: (194 * 392) / 81,337 ≈ **0.94**
- **1631 Broadway**: (170 * 335) / 90,400 ≈ **0.63**
- **185 Greenwich**: (200 * 198) / 833,945 ≈ **0.05** (this is a multi-building mega-lot; rectangle proxy reflects one component, not the whole site)

Most / least coverage (from computable examples)
- **Highest** (near 1.0): **1111 AoA**, **1221 AoA**, **345 Park** (typical Midtown tower lots built lot-line to lot-line)
- **Lowest**: **185 Greenwich** (artifact of mega-lot + multi-structure), and any records with 0 dimensions (cannot compute)

If you want, I can recompute coverage using a more reliable proxy when `bldgfront/bldgdepth` are missing (e.g., infer footprint from `builtfar` and `numfloors`: footprint ≈ bldgarea/numfloors; coverage ≈ (bldgarea/numfloors)/lotarea). That tends to behave better for towers.

## 7) Geographic clustering (lat/long): Midtown vs Lower Manhattan vs other; link to type/value

Using your latitude bands:

### Lower Manhattan (~40.70–40.72)
- **185 Greenwich** (40.7116) — mega commercial/office + retail; **highest assessment**
- **388 Greenwich** (40.7209) — large office

**Pattern:** Lower Manhattan entries here are **very high-value commercial office** assets, consistent with C6-4 zoning and large FAR.

### Midtown core (~40.75–40.76)
A large cluster:
- **Hudson Yards / West Midtown**: 500 W 33 (40.7535), 427 10 Ave (40.7545), 527 W 34 (40.7552)
- **Sixth Ave / Rockefeller / Bryant Park**: 1111 AoA (40.7556), 1221 AoA (40.7594), 1250 AoA (40.7591), 1251 AoA (40.7600), 1260 AoA (40.7595), 1271 AoA (40.7605), 1290 AoA (40.7605)
- **Park/Lex/5th/42nd/57th**: 345 Park (40.7578), 601 Lex (40.7584), 761 5 Ave (40.7636), 51 E 42 (40.7530), 9 W 57 (40.7639), 666 5 Ave (40.7604), 1631 Broadway (40.7621)

**Pattern:** Midtown cluster is overwhelmingly **C5/C6 zoning** and **O4/RC building classes** (office towers / commercial condos). This is the “trophy office” geography and dominates the high-assessment list.

### Other areas
- **Upper West Side**: 200 Central Park West (40.7814) — cultural facility (PARK zoning)
- **Roosevelt Island**: Main Street (40.7662) — large residential/mixed complex
- **Washington Heights**: 180 Ft Washington (40.8407) — institutional/hospital
- **Chelsea/Meatpacking edge**: 111 8 Ave (40.7414) — office in M1-5

**Relationship between location and type/value:**  
- **Midtown + Lower Manhattan**: highest values are primarily **commercial office** (O4/RC) in **C5/C6** zones with high FAR and strong market rents.  
- **Outside core**: high assessments still occur, but often due to **institutional scale** (hospital, museum) or **superblock residential complexes**, not necessarily high-rise office economics.

### If you want this to be exact for all 30
Paste the remaining 6 property records (or just the fields needed: `address, zonedist1, bldgclass, landuse, yearbuilt, assesstot, bldgarea, comarea, resarea, officearea, retailarea, otherarea, numfloors, lotarea, lotfront, lotdepth, bldgfront, bldgdepth, ownername, latitude, longitude`). Then I’ll:
- recompute all distributions on the full set,
- produce ranked tables (top zoning districts, top mixed-use, largest floor plates, top owners),
- and compute concentration metrics (top-5 share, Herfindahl index) for ownership.
