## 7. Private Sector vs Government Comparison

| Metric | Total Private | Government | Difference |
|--------|--------------|------------|------------|
| **Average Hire Rate** | 3.68% | 1.45% | **+2.23 pp** |
| **Average Quit Rate** | 2.21% | 0.80% | **+1.41 pp** |
| **Average Layoff Rate** | 1.23% | 0.33% | **+0.90 pp** |

**Key Findings:**

✅ **Total private sector has higher rates across all three measures:**

1. **Hire rates:** Private sector hiring is 2.5x more active than government
2. **Quit rates:** Private workers quit 2.8x more frequently, suggesting greater labor mobility and potentially better outside opportunities
3. **Layoff rates:** Private sector has 3.7x higher layoff rate, reflecting more market-driven employment adjustments

**Interpretation:** Government employment shows much greater stability (lower turnover in both directions) but also lower labor market dynamism. The very high job openings-to-hires ratio in government (2.40) combined with low hiring rates suggests significant recruitment friction in the public sector.
