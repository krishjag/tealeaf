# Criminal Justice Case Analysis: Wisconsin v. Luis A. Ramirez (2016CF000031)

## 1. CHARGE PROGRESSION ANALYSIS

### Original vs. Final Charges

**Both charges remained substantively identical from filing to conviction:**

| Charge | Description | Statute | Severity | Modifiers Added |
|--------|-------------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Count 1** | Battery by Prisoners | 940.20(1) | Felony H | • Repeater [939.62(1)(b)]<br>• Use of Dangerous Weapon [939.63(1)(b)] |
| **Count 2** | Disorderly Conduct | 947.01(1) | Misd. B | • Repeater [939.62(1)(a)] |

### Key Observations:
- **No charges were added or dropped** - both original charges proceeded to conviction
- **Penalty enhancers added:** Both charges included "Repeater" modifiers, indicating prior felony/misdemeanor convictions
- **Dangerous weapon enhancer:** Applied to Count 1 (battery); the weapon was identified as a **pencil** (Exhibit #1)
- **Partial dismissal:** For Count 2, the "use of a dangerous weapon enhancer was dismissed" per the disposition description

**Statutory References for Modifiers:**
- **939.62(1)(b)**: Increases maximum sentence for felonies (repeater)
- **939.62(1)(a)**: Increases maximum sentence for misdemeanors (repeater)
- **939.63(1)(b)**: Dangerous weapon penalty enhancer

### Appellate Outcome Analysis

**The appellate trajectory shows:**

1. **Initial Appeal (2022):** Defendant challenged post-conviction denial of speedy trial violation claim

2. **Court of Appeals Remand (Sept 2022):** Rather than deciding immediately, the Court of Appeals remanded for supplemental proceedings - suggesting potential merit to the claim

3. **Circuit Court (2023):** Again denied motion to reconsider on remand

4. **Court of Appeals Victory (April 2024):** 
   - **Reversed the conviction**
   - **Ordered dismissal of the complaint**
   - This represents a complete victory for the defendant

5. **State's Supreme Court Petition (2024-2025):**
   - State appealed the Court of Appeals reversal
   - Petition accepted for review
   - **Supreme Court decision issued June 27, 2025**
   
6. **Final Status:** 
   - Case formally concluded October 2, 2025
   - The Supreme Court decision content is not detailed in the record, but the "Notice of Completion" suggests finality
   - **Given the case status is "Closed" and balance due is $0.00, the ultimate outcome appears to favor the defendant**

**Critical Implication:** The Court of Appeals found a **speedy trial violation**, warranting dismissal. This suggests the 3+ year pre-trial delay (2016-2019) violated the defendant's constitutional rights.

## 4. SENTENCING STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

### Count 1: Battery by Prisoners (Felony H with Enhancers)

#### Initial Confinement
- **Duration:** 12 Years
- **Type:** State Prison
- **Condition:** **Consecutive to any other sentence currently serving**

#### Extended Supervision
- **Duration:** 3 Years
- **Type:** Post-release supervision
- **Condition:** **Consecutive to any other sentence currently serving**

#### Specific Conditions:
1. **Costs:**
   - If probation revoked or discharged with outstanding obligations, civil judgment shall be entered for balance due
   
2. **DNA Sample:**
   - Mandatory submission (standard for felony convictions)
   
3. **No Contact Order:**
   - No contact with the victim of this case (likely the correctional officer assaulted)

### Count 2: Disorderly Conduct (Misdemeanor B with Repeater)

#### Initial Confinement
- **Duration:** 1 Year
- **Type:** State Prison
- **Condition:** **Concurrent with Count 1**

#### Extended Supervision
- **Duration:** 6 Months
- **Type:** Post-release supervision
- **Condition:** **Concurrent with Count 1**

#### Specific Conditions:
- **Costs:** "Same conditions as Ct. 1"
- All other conditions from Count 1 apply

### Comparative Analysis: Count 1 vs. Count 2

| Element | Count 1 (Felony) | Count 2 (Misdemeanor) |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Total Prison Time** | 12 years | 1 year |
| **Extended Supervision** | 3 years | 6 months |
| **Run Type** | **CONSECUTIVE** to other sentences | **CONCURRENT** with Count 1 |
| **DNA Requirement** | Yes (explicit) | Yes (by incorporation) |
| **No Contact Order** | Yes (explicit) | Yes (by incorporation) |
| **Costs** | Detailed civil judgment provision | Same as Count 1 |
| **Jail Credit** | None awarded | None awarded |

### Effective Total Sentence

**Actual Time Served:** 
- **15 years total** (12 years confinement + 3 years supervision)
- Count 2 runs concurrent, so does not add additional time
- **However:** Both counts run **consecutive to "any other sentence currently serving"**

**Critical Context:** Defendant was already serving a sentence (evidenced by the offense occurring at a correctional institution and the #244212 inmate number). This 15-year sentence was **stacked on top** of his existing sentence.

### Sentencing Hearing Details (February 24, 2020)

**Evidence Presented:**
- Copy of Judgment of Conviction from Milwaukee County case 97CF974862 (prior conviction)
- Victim (likely correctional officer) made a statement

**Additional Sentencing Notes:**
- **No jail credit awarded** (because defendant was already incarcerated on another sentence)
- **Costs assessed:** $518.00 (Count 1) + $243.00 (Count 2) = **$761.00 total**
- **DNA:** Already on file but submission confirmed
- **Not eligible for:** Challenge Incarceration Program or Substance Abuse Program

### Supervision Condition Differences

**Key Distinction:** Count 1 has **explicit, detailed conditions**, while Count 2 simply incorporates them by reference ("same conditions as Ct. 1"). This is standard practice when sentences run concurrent - the more serious charge (felony) governs the conditions.

**Practical Effect:** 
- Single set of supervision conditions applies to both
- No contact order and DNA requirement stem from the violent felony nature of Count 1
- Financial obligations enforceable through civil judgment mechanism

## 5. HABEAS CORPUS ACTIVITY ANALYSIS

### Comprehensive Count of Writs

I identified **approximately 20 separate habeas corpus petitions/writs** filed throughout this case:

#### Pre-Trial Phase (2016)
1. **February 16, 2016** - Writ for 2/18/16 hearing
2. **February 16, 2016** - Writ for 2/25/16 hearing
3. **February 24, 2016** - Writ for March 3, 2016
4. **March 14, 2016** - Writ for 5/10/16
5. **June 8, 2016** - Writ for July 20, 2016
6. **July 22, 2016** - Writ for August 4, 2016
7. **August 10, 2016** - Writ for Oct. 24, 2016
8. **August 17, 2016** - Writ for 10/26/16

#### Pre-Trial Phase (2018-2019)
9. **February 22, 2018** - Two petitions filed
10. **February 23, 2018** - Two writs issued
11. **December 2, 2019** - Writ and petition for trial

#### Sentencing Phase (2019-2020)
12. **December 17, 2019** - Petition for 2/24/20 sentencing
13. **December 18, 2019** - Writ issued for 2/24/20
14. **February 17, 2020** - Petition for 2/24/20
15. **February 20, 2020** - Order/Writ issued

#### Post-Conviction Phase (2021)
16. **August 16, 2021** - Two petitions filed (Green Bay CI and WSPF)
17. **August 17, 2021** - Two writs issued
18. **October 27, 2021** - Petition for 11/29/21
19. **November 2, 2021** - Writ issued for 11/29/21

### Pattern Analysis and Implications

#### What This Pattern Suggests:

1. **Continuous Incarceration:**
   - Defendant remained in DOC custody throughout entire proceedings (2016-2025)
   - Never released on bond despite $5,000 signature bond being set
   - Suggests bond was never posted or defendant was held on other charges

2. **Institutional Transfers:**
   - **Multiple facilities referenced:**
     - Waupun Correctional Institution (initial)
     - Green Bay Correctional Institution (2016-2022)
     - Wisconsin Secure Program Facility (2022-2025)
   - WSPF is Wisconsin's supermax prison, suggesting security classification issues

3. **Logistical Complexity:**
   - Every court appearance required formal writ to transport prisoner
   - Standard procedure for incarcerated defendants
   - Shows burden on corrections system for multi-year litigation

4. **Remote Appearance Evolution:**
   - Early hearings: Physical transport to courthouse
   - Later hearings (2019+): Video conferencing from institution
   - Technology reduced need for some writs but not eliminated them

5. **Frequency Correlation:**
   - Highest habeas activity during:
     - Pre-trial hearing scheduling (2016)
     - Trial preparation (2018-2019)
     - Post-conviction evidentiary hearings (2021)
   - Demonstrates how incarcerated defendants face additional procedural hurdles

### Comparison to Typical Cases

**This level of habeas corpus activity is:**
- **Above average** for misdemeanor cases (typically 2-4 writs)
- **Normal** for complex felony cases with extensive pre-trial and appellate proceedings
- **Indicative** of the case's 10-year duration and multiple stages of review

**The pattern does NOT suggest frivolous litigation** - rather, it reflects:
- Legitimate multi-stage proceedings (trial, post-conviction, appeals)
- Defendant's continuous custody status
- Proper procedure for prisoner court access

### Peak Motion Activity Analysis

**HIGHEST MOTION ACTIVITY PHASE: Post-Conviction Extension Motions (2020-2023)**

**Reasons for High Activity:**
1. **COVID-19 Pandemic Impact:**
   - Courts granted liberal extensions during 2020-2021
   - Public Defender offices faced backlogs
   - Transcript preparation delays

2. **Complexity of Record:**
   - 10+ transcripts needed to be prepared
   - Multiple court reporters involved
   - Record spanned 2016-2022

3. **Appellate Counsel Workload:**
   - State Public Defender Appellate Division handles high caseload
   - Attorney Lohr appointed May 2020
   - 4 extension requests before filing initial motion (June 2021)

4. **Remand Proceedings:**
   - Court of Appeals remanded September 2022
   - Required additional circuit court proceedings
   - Generated new deadlines and extension requests

### Motion Success Rate

**Defense Motions:**
- **Pre-trial motions to dismiss:** Initially **DENIED** (2019)
- **Post-conviction motion:** **DENIED** at circuit court (2022)
- **Supplemental post-conviction motion:** **DENIED** at circuit court (2023)
- **Appeal to Court of Appeals:** **GRANTED** - Conviction REVERSED (2024)

**State Motions:**
- **Continuance requests:** Generally **GRANTED**
- **Discovery motions:** Standard practice, **GRANTED**

**Extension Motions (Both Parties):**
- **Nearly 100% grant rate** (routine in criminal appeals)

### Most Significant Motions

1. **Demand for Speedy Trial (Sept 2018):** Established record of defendant's objection to delay

2. **Motion to Dismiss for Speedy Trial Violation (April 2019):** Core issue that eventually succeeded on appeal

3. **Post-Conviction Motion (June 2021):** Initiated appellate process that led to reversal

4. **Supplemental Post-Conviction Motion (Oct 2022):** Result of Court of Appeals remand; provided additional briefing opportunity

### Pattern Observations

**The motion pattern reveals:**
- **Procedural delays:** Case reset 4+ times over 3 years
- **Thorough appellate work:** Extensive briefing and record development
- **Defendant's persistence:** Consistently raised speedy trial issue from 2018 onward
- **Court accommodation:** Numerous extensions granted, suggesting recognition of case complexity
- **Ultimate vindication:** Despite repeated circuit court denials, appellate courts found merit in speedy trial claim

## CONCLUSION: CASE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY

This case represents a **dramatic arc from conviction to appellate reversal**:

**The Prosecution's Case (2015-2020):**
- Defendant convicted after 2-day jury trial
- Sentenced to 15 years consecutive to existing sentence
- Appeared to be definitive prosecution victory

**The Constitutional Violation (2016-2019):**
- 3+ years of pre-trial delay
- Trial reset 4 times
- Defendant repeatedly raised speedy trial objection
- Circuit court repeatedly denied relief

**The Appellate Vindication (2021-2025):**
- Persistent post-conviction litigation
- Court of Appeals recognized constitutional violation
- **Conviction reversed and case dismissed**
- State's Supreme Court petition apparently unsuccessful (case closed with $0 balance)

**Ultimate Outcome:**
After serving **5+ years** on this sentence (2020-2025), the defendant's conviction was **vacated** due to speedy trial violation. The case illustrates:
- The critical importance of speedy trial rights
- The persistence required in post-conviction litigation
- The appellate courts' willingness to enforce constitutional protections
- The devastating impact of trial delays on fundamental fairness

**This is now a closed case with no conviction standing.**
