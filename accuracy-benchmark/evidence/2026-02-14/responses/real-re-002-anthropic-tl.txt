# Analysis of Manhattan's Highest-Value Properties

## 1. Zoning District Distribution

### Zoning Frequency Analysis:
- **C6 zones (14 properties)**: C6-4 (5), C6-6 (3), C6-5.5 (3), C6-6.5 (1), C6-7 (1), C6-4.5 (1)
- **C5 zones (10 properties)**: C5-3 (5), C5-2.5 (5)
- **R zones (3 properties)**: R7-2 (2), R8 (1)
- **M zones (2 properties)**: M2-3 (1), M1-5 (1)
- **PARK (1 property)**

### Key Findings:
**Commercial zones dominate** (24 of 30 properties), with C6 high-density commercial districts being most common. These permit:
- C6: High-density commercial/residential, FAR 10-15, typically Midtown towers
- C5: General commercial, FAR 10-15, mixed office/retail

**Manufacturing zone properties:**
- **360 West Street** (M2-3, Convention Center) - $931.4M assessed
- **111 8 Avenue** (M1-5, former manufacturing) - $531.1M assessed

**Residential zone anomalies:**
- **240 1 Avenue** (R7-2) - $791.8M, mixed-use conversion
- **Main Street** (R7-2) - $534.0M, affordable housing complex
- **180 Ft Washington Avenue** (R8) - $460.3M, hospital facility

The presence of high-value properties in M and R zones suggests **zoning variances, conversions, or pre-existing non-conforming uses**.

## 6. Lot Coverage Analysis

| Property | Lot Area (sf) | Implied Building Footprint* | Coverage Ratio | Address |
|----------|---------------|---------------------------|----------------|---------|
| **Highest Coverage:** |
| 345 Park Ave | 81,337 | 76,088 | **93.5%** | Near full lot coverage |
| 1271 Ave Americas | 82,340 | 82,410 | **100.1%** | Tower fills lot |
| 666 5th Ave | 61,755 | 63,000 | **102.0%** | Tower fills lot |
| 1211 Ave Americas | 84,855 | 79,148 | **93.3%** | Near full lot coverage |
| 9 West 57 St | 62,058 | 50,292 | **81.0%** | High coverage |
| **Lowest Coverage:** |
| 185 Greenwich (3 WTC) | 833,945 | 39,600 | **4.7%** | Tower on large plaza |
| Main Street (Riverwalk) | 4,227,757 | 0 | **0%** | Campus layout |

| American Museum | 738,000 | 120,000 | **16.3%** | Campus with open space |

*Calculated as bldgfront × bldgdepth (where available)

### Key Patterns:
- **Midtown office towers (1960s-1970s)** typically achieve **80-100% lot coverage**, maximizing FAR
- **Modern towers (2000s+)** on large lots show **lower coverage** (<50%), with:
  - Required plaza space
  - Setbacks for slender towers
  - Public amenities (3 WTC has major plaza)
- **Institutional properties** show low coverage due to:
  - Campus layouts
  - Open space requirements
  - Multiple buildings

**Finding**: Older Midtown properties maximize lot coverage under pre-1961 zoning, while modern towers trade footprint for height under current FAR bonuses.

2. **Hudson Yards cluster (West 30s-40s)** shows:
   - 5 properties totaling $3.4B
   - Newest construction (2013-2019)
   - Rezoning from manufacturing to C6-4
   - Convention Center anchor
