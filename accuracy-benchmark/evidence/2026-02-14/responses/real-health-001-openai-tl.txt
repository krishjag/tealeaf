## 2) Highest vs lowest obesity (OBESITY)

- **Highest:** **Yakima** — **39.7%** (35.3–44.1)  
- **Lowest:** **King** — **22.6%** (20.4–24.9)

(Next-highest: Ferry 40.2 is actually *higher than Yakima*; correcting based on values: **Ferry 40.2%** (33.4–47.9) is the highest, then Yakima 39.7%.)

**Final answer:**
- **Highest obesity:** **Ferry (40.2%)**  
- **Lowest obesity:** **King (22.6%)**

## 3) Diabetes (DIABETES) ranking (highest → lowest)

1. **Ferry:** **15.1** (13.1–17.5)  
2. **Yakima:** **12.9** (11.4–14.5)  
3. **Garfield:** **11.5** (9.8–13.4)  
4. **Pierce:** **10.6** (9.3–11.8)  
5. **Benton:** **10.4** (9.1–11.8)  
6. **Spokane:** **10.2** (8.9–11.5)  
7. **Island:** **10.2** (8.8–11.9)  
8. **Clark:** **9.6** (8.4–10.8)  
9. **Whatcom:** **8.8** (7.6–10.1)  
10. **King:** **7.3** (6.6–8.2)

## 4) King (urban) vs Ferry (rural): selected indicators

Crude prevalence %, (95% CI)

| Measure | King | Ferry | Difference (Ferry − King) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Current smoking (CSMOKING) | 7.2 (5.8–8.9) | 16.0 (13.5–19.0) | **+8.8** |
| Obesity (OBESITY) | 22.6 (20.4–24.9) | 40.2 (33.4–47.9) | **+17.6** |
| Depression (DEPRESSION) | 23.5 (21.7–25.3) | 25.0 (21.7–28.8) | **+1.5** |
| Lack of insurance (ACCESS2) | 6.8 (5.5–8.4) | 8.5 (6.9–10.4) | **+1.7** |

Key takeaways: Ferry is substantially higher on **smoking** and **obesity**, modestly higher on **uninsurance**, and slightly higher on **depression**.

## 5) Widest disparity in **Health Risk Behaviors (RISKBEH)** across counties

Risk behaviors included: **BINGE, CSMOKING, LPA, SLEEP**.

Compute max–min (percentage-point spread):

- **Binge drinking (BINGE):** max 17.9 (Whatcom) – min 14.0 (Ferry) = **3.9**
- **Smoking (CSMOKING):** max 16.0 (Ferry) – min 7.2 (King) = **8.8**
- **Physical inactivity (LPA):** max 27.9 (Yakima) – min 13.9 (King) = **14.0**
- **Short sleep (SLEEP):** max 37.0 (Pierce) – min 29.0 (King/Island) = **8.0**

**Widest disparity:** **Physical inactivity (LPA)** with a **14.0 percentage-point** spread (Yakima highest, King lowest).

## 6) Counties where **>3 health outcomes** are **≥5 points above** the 10-county average

I computed 10-county averages for each HLTHOUT measure and flagged counties where a measure is **(county − average) ≥ 5.0** percentage points, then counted flags per county.

**Result: No county meets the criterion of “more than 3” HLTHOUT measures ≥5 points above the 10-county average.**

Closest/high-burden patterns (but still not >3):
- **Ferry:** 3 measures ≥5 above average (**ARTHRITIS, BPHIGH, CHD**)  
- **Yakima:** 2 measures ≥5 above average (**OBESITY, TEETHLOST**)  
- **Pierce:** 2 measures ≥5 above average (**OBESITY, TEETHLOST**)

If you want, I can provide the underlying 10-county averages per HLTHOUT measure and the full flag table by county/measure.
