## 1) Highest vs lowest average Job Openings rate (JO rate)

Average JO rate over 2025 (percent of employment):

**Highest (top 3)**
1. **Accommodation & food services:** **5.85%**
2. **Leisure & hospitality:** **5.78%**
3. **Health care & social assistance:** **5.68%**

**Lowest (bottom 3)**
1. **Construction:** **2.90%**
2. **Government:** **3.34%**
3. **Manufacturing:** **3.19%** *(third-lowest; slightly below Retail at 3.58 and Information at 4.89, etc.)*

**Interpretation (labor demand):**  
High JO rates in **hospitality/food** and **health care** signal persistently strong labor demand relative to employment—often associated with high turnover, hard-to-fill roles, and/or rapid replacement needs. Low JO rates in **construction, manufacturing, and government** suggest comparatively less vacancy pressure (either weaker demand, better matching, slower hiring processes, or more stable staffing).

## 2) Labor market churn by industry (avg over year)
Definition: **Churn level = (Hires level + Total separations level) / 2**, averaged across months. (Levels in **thousands**.)

**Ranked highest → lowest churn (avg 2025):**
1. **Total nonfarm:** **5,292**
2. **Total private:** **4,913**
3. **Professional & business services:** **1,006**
4. **Leisure & hospitality:** **951**
5. **Retail trade:** **596**
6. **Health care & social assistance:** **702**
7. **Accommodation & food services:** **797**
8. **Government:** **331**
9. **Manufacturing:** **313**
10. **Construction:** **347**
11. **Financial activities:** **206**
12. **Information:** **90**

Notes:
- The “Total” aggregates are mechanically largest.
- Among detailed industries, **Professional & business services** and **Leisure & hospitality** show the highest worker-flow intensity.

## 3) Net hiring rate (avg HI rate − avg TS rate)
Computed from average rates over 2025.

**Positive (growing):**
- **Government:** **+0.12 pp** (HI 1.43 − TS 1.31)
- **Health care & social assistance:** **+0.25 pp** (3.12 − 2.87)
- **Leisure & hospitality:** **+0.20 pp** (5.72 − 5.52)
- **Accommodation & food services:** **+0.27 pp** (5.65 − 5.38)

**Negative (shrinking):**
- **Total nonfarm:** **−0.01 pp**
- **Total private:** **−0.01 pp**
- **Construction:** **−0.02 pp**
- **Manufacturing:** **−0.16 pp**
- **Retail trade:** **−0.01 pp**
- **Information:** **−0.03 pp**
- **Financial activities:** **−0.04 pp**
- **Professional & business services:** **−0.10 pp**

**Interpretation:**  
Growth is concentrated in **public sector and people-intensive services** (health care, hospitality/food). Mildly negative net rates in several sectors suggest either flat employment or slight contraction on average in 2025.

## 4) Leisure & hospitality vs Professional & business services (avg rates, 2025)

Average rates (percent of employment):

| Metric (rate) | Leisure & hospitality | Prof & business services |
|---|---:|---:|
| **JO** | **5.78** | **5.48** |
| **HI** | **5.72** | **4.59** |
| **TS** | **5.52** | **4.69** |
| **QU** | **3.98** | **2.36** |
| **LD** | **1.40** | **2.00** |
| **OS** | **0.13** | **0.23** |

**Structural differences implied:**
- **Much higher quits in Leisure & hospitality (3.98 vs 2.36):** indicates a more fluid, worker-driven separation pattern (shorter job tenures, frequent job switching).
- **Higher layoffs/discharges in Professional & business services (2.00 vs 1.40):** suggests more employer-driven adjustment (project cycles, contracting, business demand sensitivity, restructuring).
- **Both have high JO rates (~5.5–5.8):** both face meaningful vacancy pressure, but **hospitality fills/loses workers faster** (higher HI and TS).
- **Other separations are small in both**, but slightly higher in PBS (0.23 vs 0.13), consistent with a somewhat more diverse set of non-quit exits.

## 5) Seasonality in Construction hires (levels)
Construction hires level by month (thousands):

- **Highest:** **April = 364**
- **Lowest:** **March = 306**
- **Range:** **364 − 306 = 58 (thousand)**

This pattern is consistent with spring ramp-up.

---

## 6) Composition of separations: quits vs layoffs vs other (shares of TS, using levels)

For each industry, compute over the year:
- Quit share = QU / TS
- Layoff share = LD / TS
- Other share = OS / TS  
(using annual averages of levels; equivalently sums since months are equally weighted)

**Shares (approx %):**

- **Total nonfarm:** Quits **61.1%**, Layoffs **32.8%**, Other **6.1%**
- **Total private:** Quits **61.9%**, Layoffs **32.9%**, Other **5.2%**
- **Construction:** Quits **44.9%**, Layoffs **50.7%**, Other **4.4%**
- **Manufacturing:** Quits **56.6%**, Layoffs **37.1%**, Other **6.3%**
- **Retail trade:** Quits **68.7%**, Layoffs **27.9%**, Other **3.4%**
- **Information:** Quits **47.4%**, Layoffs **42.7%**, Other **9.9%**
- **Financial activities:** Quits **60.6%**, Layoffs **27.7%**, Other **11.7%**
- **Professional & business services:** Quits **52.9%**, Layoffs **42.5%**, Other **4.6%**
- **Health care & social assistance:** Quits **70.4%**, Layoffs **24.2%**, Other **5.4%**
- **Leisure & hospitality:** Quits **72.1%**, Layoffs **25.4%**, Other **2.5%**
- **Accommodation & food services:** Quits **76.5%**, Layoffs **20.0%**, Other **3.5%**
- **Government:** Quits **56.8%**, Layoffs **25.5%**, Other **17.7%**

**Highest quit share:** **Accommodation & food services (~76.5%)**  
**Highest layoff share:** **Construction (~50.7%)**

## 7) “Ratio of unemployed persons implied by job openings” for Total nonfarm

To compute a **job openings–to–unemployed** tightness ratio (or its inverse), you need **both**:
- Job openings level (you provided): Total nonfarm average JO level in 2025 = **7,327 thousand**
- **Number of unemployed persons (level)** (not provided in your dataset). This comes from CPS (BLS unemployment level), not JOLTS.

What I *can* provide from your data:
- **Average Total nonfarm JO level (2025): ~7.33 million**
- **Average Total nonfarm JO rate (2025): ~4.37%**

If you supply (or let me assume) the **average 2025 unemployed level** (e.g., annual average unemployed persons, in thousands), then:
- **Openings per unemployed = JO / Unemployed**
- **Unemployed per opening = Unemployed / JO**

Example formula (using thousands consistently):
- If unemployed = **U** (thousand), then **openings per unemployed = 7,327 / U**.

If you want, tell me whether you want this ratio using:
- annual average unemployed level for **2025**, or
- a specific month (to match a month’s JO level).
