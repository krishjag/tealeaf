## 1) Zoning district distribution (zonedist1) + what it permits; M vs C vs R

### Frequency of `zonedist1` in the provided records (n=24 shown)
(Your prompt says 30 lots, but the table excerpt contains 24 records; counts below reflect what’s visible.)

| zonedist1 | count | broad type |
|---|---:|---|
| **C6-4** | **5** | Commercial (high bulk, mixed commercial/residential allowed depending on subdistrict/context) |
| **C5-2.5** | **4** | Commercial (Midtown core high-density office/retail) |
| **C6-6** | **3** | Commercial (very high density; major office towers) |
| **C6-5.5** | **3** | Commercial |
| C5-3 | 2 | Commercial (prime Midtown retail/office corridors) |
| R7-2 | 2 | Residential (medium/high density res; can have contextual overlays) |
| PARK | 1 | Special purpose (parkland / institutional) |
| M2-3 | 1 | Manufacturing |
| M1-5 | 1 | Manufacturing (light manufacturing / commercial loft type) |
| C6-7 | 1 | Commercial |
| C6-6.5 | 1 | Commercial |
| R8 | 1 | Residential (higher density res) |

**Takeaway:** These highest-assessed lots are overwhelmingly in **high-density commercial districts (C5/C6)**—especially Midtown and Hudson Yards—consistent with trophy office towers, major retail, and large mixed commercial buildings.

### Which properties are in M vs C vs R zones?

**Manufacturing zones (M):**
- **360 WEST STREET** — `M2-3` (landuse 8; convention center)
- **111 8 AVENUE** — `M1-5` (landuse 5; large commercial building in a manufacturing district)

**Residential zones (R):**
- **240 1 AVENUE** — `R7-2` (landuse 4; large residential/mixed)
- **MAIN STREET (Roosevelt Island)** — `R7-2` (landuse 3; residential)
- **180 FT WASHINGTON AVENUE** — `R8` (landuse 8; hospital/institutional use in res zone)

**Commercial zones (C):** (the rest)
- Examples: **1 COLUMBUS CIRCLE (C6-6)**, **761 5 AVENUE (C5-3)**, **1111 AVE OF THE AMER (C6-6)**, **One Vanderbilt (C5-3)**, Rockefeller Center buildings, etc.

**What zoning implies (high-level):**
- **C5- / C6- districts**: permit very high-density **office/retail/hotel** and often allow **residential** (especially in mixed-use contexts), governed by FAR caps and special district rules (MiD = Midtown Special District; HY = Hudson Yards).
- **M1/M2**: permit manufacturing/warehouse and many commercial uses; residential is generally not permitted as-of-right (except via special provisions/rezonings).
- **R7-2 / R8**: primarily residential bulk envelopes; commercial typically limited to overlays or ground-floor allowances.

## 2) Building age profile by decade + assessed value relationship (avg assesstot per decade)

### Decade grouping (from `yearbuilt`) and average `assesstot`
(Again: based on the 24 visible records.)

| decade built | properties (count) | average assesstot |
|---|---:|---:|
| **1930s** | 4 | **$540.7M** |
| **1940s** | 1 | **$791.8M** |
| **1950s** | 1 | **$449.8M** |
| **1960s** | 5 | **$664.2M** |
| **1970s** | 5 | **$492.0M** |
| **1980s** | 1 | **$520.0M** |
| **1990s** | 1 | **$474.4M** |
| **2000s** | 3 | **$696.0M** |
| **2010s** | 3 | **$661.5M** |

### Relationship: newer ≠ always higher, but recent mega-projects are high
- The **very top assessed lot** in the excerpt is **2009** (185 Greenwich St) at **$1.673B**, which strongly lifts the 2000s average.
- **2010s** includes Hudson Yards / new towers (2015, 2017, 2018, 2019) with consistently high assessments (generally **$520M–$744M** in this slice).
- But **older landmark office stock** (1930s–1970s) also dominates the high-value list because location (Midtown core) + scale + office use drives assessments.

**Conclusion:** There’s a *weak-to-moderate* tendency for **newer, very large Class A towers** to be highly assessed, but **prime Midtown location and office intensity** allow many mid-century buildings to remain in the same valuation tier.

## 3) Area composition (% of bldgarea) + mixed-use vs single-purpose

Method: for each property, compute shares of `bldgarea`:
- commercial = `comarea / bldgarea`
- residential = `resarea / bldgarea`
- office = `officearea / bldgarea`
- retail = `retailarea / bldgarea`
- “other” = `(bldgarea - comarea - resarea)` (note: PLUTO sub-areas like office/retail are typically components of comarea; “other” here is mainly non-com/res remainder, not a perfect use taxonomy)

### Most mixed-use (multiple area types > 0)
Properties with **both resarea > 0 and comarea > 0** (true mixed res/com in this set):
- **1 COLUMBUS CIRCLE (Time Warner Center Condo)**: comarea 1,446,974; resarea 441,891; also large office + retail components.
- **151 EAST 58 STREET (One Beacon Court Condo)**: comarea 856,242; resarea 246,927.
- **MAIN STREET (Roosevelt Island)**: comarea 1,046,956; resarea 3,739,745 (predominantly residential but has commercial area).
- **240 1 AVENUE**: comarea 574,234; resarea 8,367,942 (overwhelmingly residential with some commercial).

Properties with **multiple commercial subtypes** (office + retail + other commercial components):
- Many Midtown O4 towers show officearea and retailarea both > 0 (e.g., **345 Park Ave**, **761 5 Ave**, **1631 Broadway**, **250 W 34 St**, etc.)

### Single-purpose / near single-purpose
- **Purely commercial by area (resarea = 0, comarea ≈ bldgarea):** most O4/RC towers (e.g., **1111 Avenue of the Americas**, **338 5 Avenue (ESB)**, **388 Greenwich**, **527 W 34**, **427 10 Ave**, etc.)
- **Purely residential by area (comarea small or 0):** not many are purely res here; the closest is where res dominates strongly (e.g., **240 1 Avenue**).
- **Institutional/special:**  
  - **200 Central Park West (PARK; museum)** has comarea=bldgarea but that’s “commercial area” in PLUTO terms; functionally it’s institutional/cultural.  
  - **360 West Street (convention center)**: comarea=bldgarea, but use is public facility.

If you want, I can output a per-building table of the exact percentages for all 24 shown records; it’s straightforward but long.

## 4) numfloors vs bldgarea; average floor plate (bldgarea / numfloors); largest floor plates; pattern by building class

Computed **average floor plate** = `bldgarea / numfloors`.

### Largest floor plates (top examples)
- **240 1 AVENUE (D7)**: 8,942,176 / 13 ≈ **687,860 sf/floor** (extremely large; likely campus-style/large footprint + multiple buildings effect; note `numbldgs=39` suggests this “lot” aggregates many structures, so floor-plate metric is not a single tower plate)
- **360 WEST STREET (P9)**: 4,060,596 / 4 ≈ **1,015,149 sf/floor** (convention center scale; again not a typical tower)
- **180 FT WASHINGTON AVE (I1)**: 3,693,539 / 22 ≈ **167,888 sf/floor** (hospital complex; may include multiple wings)
- **1260 AVE OF THE AMER (O4)**: 2,734,038 / 31 ≈ **88,195 sf/floor**
- **111 8 AVENUE (O6)**: 2,161,994 / 17 ≈ **127,176 sf/floor** (large block-building)

### Pattern by building class
- **O4 (office buildings)**: generally large floor plates but within a “tower” range (often ~30k–90k sf/floor here), except where the lot aggregates multiple structures.
- **P9 / I1 / D7 (public facility / hospital / elevator apartment)**: can show **very large implied plates** because the “building area” may represent **multi-structure complexes** or low-rise mega-footprints.
- **RC/RM (condo records)**: floor-plate metric can be misleading because condo lot records may represent a condo tax lot structure rather than a single building massing.

## 5) Top 5 owners by total assessed value; ownership concentration; repeat owners

From the visible records, summing `assesstot` by `ownername`:

1. **LOWER MANHATTAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION** — **$1.673B** (185 Greenwich St)
2. **NEW YORK CONVENTION CENTER** — **$931.4M** (360 West St)
3. **TIME WARNER CENTER CONDOMINIUM** — **$794.4M**
4. **BPP ST OWNER LLC** — **$791.8M**
5. **767 FIFTH PARTNERS LLC** — **$791.1M**

**Repeat owners (appear multiple times in the excerpt):**
- Several are “UNAVAILABLE OWNER” (appears multiple times) but that’s a data-quality placeholder, not a true owner concentration signal.
- Most named owners appear once in this slice (e.g., One Vanderbilt Owner LLC once; ESRT once; Solovieff once; Rockefeller entities once each).

**Concentration:** In this visible subset, the top 2 owners alone account for roughly **$2.6B** assessed value. But because many owners are unique (or masked), the list looks **less concentrated** than it likely is in reality (where large REITs/institutional owners often repeat).

## 6) Lot vs building dimensions; lot coverage ratio (bldgfront*bldgdepth / lotarea); most/least coverage

Computed **implied footprint** = `bldgfront * bldgdepth` and **coverage** = footprint / lotarea.
Caveat: PLUTO `bldgfront`/`bldgdepth` are not perfect footprint measures for complex shapes; still useful for comparison.

### Highest implied lot coverage (examples)
- **51 EAST 42 STREET (One Vanderbilt)**: footprint ≈ 200.83*215.67 ≈ 43,300 sf; lotarea 44,048 → **~0.98** (very high coverage)
- **1111 AVENUE OF THE AMER (One Bryant Park)**: 201*437 ≈ 87,837; lotarea 87,863 → **~1.00**
- **338 5 AVENUE (Empire State Building)**: 198*425 ≈ 84,150; lotarea 91,351 → **~0.92**
- **388 GREENWICH STREET**: 178*270 ≈ 48,060; lotarea 172,327 → **~0.28** (not “high,” but shows how many towers don’t cover most of the lot)

### Lowest implied lot coverage (examples)
- **527 WEST 34 STREET** has bldgfront/bldgdepth recorded as 0,0 → coverage computes to **0** (likely missing/unknown dimensions rather than true).
- **MAIN STREET (Roosevelt Island)** has bldgfront/bldgdepth 0,0 → also **0** (again likely not meaningful).
- Among records with nonzero dimensions, large-campus lots (e.g., convention center / institutional) can show lower ratios depending on how dimensions are recorded.

If you want “most/least” excluding zero-dimension records (data missing), I can recompute with a filter `bldgfront>0 and bldgdepth>0`.

## 7) Geographic clustering (lat/long): Midtown vs Lower Manhattan vs other; relationship to type/value

### Clear clustering by latitude band
**Lower Manhattan (≈ 40.70–40.72):**
- **185 Greenwich St** (40.7116) — extremely high assessed value; major redevelopment/office complex
- **388 Greenwich St** (40.7209) — large office (Citigroup)

**Midtown Core / Midtown West (≈ 40.75–40.763):**
A large majority of the list:
- **Rockefeller Center / Avenue of the Americas corridor** (40.758–40.760)
- **Bryant Park / 42nd St** (One Bryant Park, One Vanderbilt)
- **Hudson Yards / Far West Midtown** (500 W 33, 427 10 Ave, 527 W 34)

**Upper West Side / Central Park West (≈ 40.78):**
- **200 Central Park West** (40.7813) — museum/institutional, high assessed but different landuse

**Upper Manhattan / Washington Heights (≈ 40.84):**
- **180 Ft Washington Ave** (40.8407) — hospital complex, high assessed but institutional

**Roosevelt Island (≈ 40.766, but longitude -73.946):**
- **Main Street** — residential complex; geographically distinct from Midtown despite similar latitude

### Relationship between location and property type/value
- **Midtown** dominates and is mostly **landuse 5 (Commercial & Office)** with **O4/RC** building classes and **C5/C6 zoning**—consistent with Manhattan’s highest land values and FAR-intensive office development.
- **Lower Manhattan** entries are fewer in this slice but include **very high assessed value** redevelopment-scale properties.
- **Non-core areas** (Upper Manhattan, parks/institutions, Roosevelt Island) appear mainly as **institutional or large residential complexes**, which can still be highly assessed due to sheer size, but are less “trophy office” in character.

### If you want this tightened into reproducible outputs
I can return:
- a frequency table for `zonedist1` for all **30** (if you provide the missing 6 records),
- a full per-property table with: decade, assesstot, use percentages, floor plate, coverage ratio, and a Midtown/Lower/Other label.
