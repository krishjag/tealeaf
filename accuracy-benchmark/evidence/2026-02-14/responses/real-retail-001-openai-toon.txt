I can’t complete the requested *across-all-25-products* calculations from what you pasted because the dataset is truncated in this chat view: I can only see full nutrient detail for some items, and several products are cut off mid-record. Also, at least one product (e.g., **Boo Berry Halloween Breakfast Cereal**, fdcId **2738640**) contains **multiple duplicated nutrient blocks** (likely “per serving”, “per 100 g”, and possibly “with milk” variants) inside the same `foodNutrients[]`. To do correct per‑100 g comparisons, I must select the *right* entry per nutrient (preferably the one that is explicitly per 100 g, e.g., derivation `LCGA` “per 100 unit measure”, or otherwise consistently use the `value` field that your export states is “per 100 g”).

If you paste/provide the full JSON for `foods[]` (all 25 items with complete `foodNutrients[]`), or upload it as a file, I’ll compute everything exactly and return the full tables and rankings.

Meanwhile, here’s what I **can** do reliably from the products that are fully visible and have a single coherent per‑100 g macro set in the excerpt (notably: Bauducco cookie; belVita; Breakfast Pack; Bluey cereals; Dragons Blend; Nature’s Promise biscuits; many General Mills cereals like Cheerios/Chex/Lucky Charms/Total/Trix). I’ll also outline the exact rules I’ll apply once you provide the full dataset.

## Method I will apply (once full data is provided)

For each food:
- Extract per 100 g values for:
  - Energy (kcal): nutrientId **1008**
  - Protein (g): **1003**
  - Total fat (g): **1004**
  - Carbs (g): **1005**
  - Total sugars (g): **2000**
  - Fiber (g): **1079**
- If multiple entries exist for the same nutrient:
  1) Prefer derivationCode **LCGA** (“approx per 100 unit measure”) if present  
  2) Else use the entry whose `value` is consistent with per‑100 g scaling from serving size (common in branded exports)  
  3) If still ambiguous (e.g., “with milk” vs “dry”), flag and exclude or resolve using additional fields if present in your raw JSON.

Then compute:
- Sugar-to-fiber ratio = sugars (g) / fiber (g).  
  - If fiber = 0, ratio is undefined/infinite; I’ll treat as worst and flag.
- Rankings and averages as requested.

## Partial results from the visible records (illustrative, not final for all 25)

### 1) Nutrition summary table (per 100 g) — items clearly visible
(Values are per 100 g as shown in your excerpt.)

| 2746531 | Rice Chex | General Mills Sales Inc. | 375 | 7.5 | 2.5 | 87.5 | 7.5 | 5.0 |
| 2746605 | Total | General Mills Sales Inc. | 350 | 7.5 | 2.5 | 82.5 | 15.0 | 10.0 |

Notes:
- belVita entries in your excerpt do **not** include Energy or total carbs (1005) in the shown nutrient subset, so those cells are missing here.
- Cheerios and Boo Berry records are present but **their nutrient arrays are duplicated/multi-context** in the excerpt; I’m not using them until the full JSON is available to disambiguate cleanly.

## 2) Sugar-to-fiber ratio (from the visible, usable items)

Sugar-to-fiber = sugars / fiber:

- **Best (lowest)** among the above:  
  **Bluey Breakfast Cereal (Kix)**: 10.0 / 7.5 = **1.33**

- **Worst (highest)** among the above:  
  **Breakfast Pack Cereal**: 33.3 / 6.1 ≈ **5.46**  
  (Lucky Charms and Cookie Crisp are also high: 33.3/5.6 ≈ 5.95, which is actually *higher* than 5.46—so among the items computed here, **Lucky Charms** and **Cookie Crisp** are worse at **~5.95**.)

So, with the partial set:
- **Lowest ratio:** Bluey Breakfast Cereal (~1.33)  
- **Highest ratio:** Lucky Charms and Cookie Crisp (~5.95)

Final answer may change when the missing products are included (especially if any have very low fiber or very high sugar).

## 3) Rank by protein per 100 g (partial list) + range

Highest to lowest (from the computed subset):

1. **Dragons Blend Breakfast Cereal** – 21.4 g  
2. **Nature’s Promise Milk & Cereal Biscuits** – 10.7 g  
3. **Bauducco Breakfast Cookie** – 9.09 g  
3. **Breakfast Pack Cereal** – 9.09 g (tie)  
5. **Lucky Charms** – 8.33 g  
5. **Chocolate Cheerios** – 8.33 g (tie)  
7. **Bluey Breakfast Cereal** – 7.5 g (and its 2-pack/family size)  
7. **Rice Chex** – 7.5 g  
7. **Total** – 7.5 g  
10. **Cookie Crisp** – 5.56 g  
11. **Trix Mini** – 5.49 g (and duplicate GTIN)  
12. **Cinnamon Chex** – 5.0 g (both GTINs)  
13. **Chocolate Chex** – 4.65 g  
14. **Trix Loaded** – 4.61 g  

**Range (max − min)** in this partial set:  
21.4 − 4.61 = **16.79 g protein per 100 g**

---

## 4) Micronutrients: iron and calcium (partial)

From the visible items:

- **Most iron-fortified (highest Fe mg/100 g)** in the usable subset:  
  **Total Breakfast Cereal** – **45 mg Fe/100 g**  
  Next highest: Rice Chex 36 mg; Chocolate Chex 29.3 mg; Bluey 27 mg.

- **Most calcium (highest Ca mg/100 g)** in the usable subset:  
  Several cluster around ~325–361 mg. Highest seen here:  
  **Chocolate Cheerios / Cookie Crisp / Lucky Charms** – **361 mg Ca/100 g** (tie)  
  (Cheerios variants show ~333 mg in some entries; Bluey 325 mg.)

Again, final winners could change once all 25 are processed.

---

## 5) Average sodium + products >500 mg and <200 mg (partial)

Sodium values available in the usable subset (mg/100 g):
- Bauducco 227
- Breakfast Pack 636
- Bluey 450 (x3)
- Dragons Blend 0
- Nature’s Promise 250
- Rice Chex 775
- Total 475
- Lucky Charms 611
- Cinnamon Chex 575 (x2)
- Chocolate Chex 581
- Chocolate Cheerios 500
- Cookie Crisp 528
- Trix Loaded 267
- Trix Mini 505 (x2)

**Average sodium (these 20 records)**:
Sum = 9,932 mg across 20 items → **~497 mg/100 g**

**Exceed 500 mg/100 g** (strictly >500):
- Breakfast Pack (636)
- Rice Chex (775)
- Lucky Charms (611)
- Cinnamon Chex (575) (both)
- Chocolate Chex (581)
- Cookie Crisp (528)
- Trix Mini (505) (both)

**Below 200 mg/100 g**:
- Dragons Blend (0 mg)

(If you want “≤200”, then only Dragons Blend qualifies in this subset.)

## 6) General Mills vs non–General Mills averages (partial, based on usable rows)

### General Mills (from the usable GM items above; n=16)
Averages (per 100 g):
- **Calories:** ~389 kcal
- **Sugars:** ~21.9 g
- **Fiber:** ~5.9 g
- **Protein:** ~6.5 g

### Non–General Mills (usable non-GM items above; n=3)
(Bauducco, Dragons Blend, Nature’s Promise)
- **Calories:** ~451 kcal
- **Sugars:** ~17.8 g
- **Fiber:** ~11.2 g
- **Protein:** ~13.7 g

Interpretation (with strong caveat about missing products): the non‑GM items visible here include a seed-based cereal and biscuit/cookie products, which skew protein/fiber and calories upward relative to typical refined cereals.

---

## 7) Vitamin D percentDailyValue presence + range (partial)

From the visible GM cereals, many include Vitamin D with percentDV (typically 15–20%). In the excerpt:
- Bluey: **20%**
- Cheerios variants: **20%** (cup shows **15%**)
- Chex variants: **20%**
- Lucky Charms: **20%**
- Total: **20%**
- Nature’s Promise biscuits: Vitamin D IU present but **0%**
- Bauducco cookie: no Vitamin D shown
- Dragons Blend: no Vitamin D shown

**Highest Vitamin D %DV seen in the excerpt:** **20%** (many GM cereals tie)

However, I cannot accurately answer:
- “How many products have a percentDailyValue for Vitamin D?” across all 25
- the true range across all 25  
until I can see all foods and their Vitamin D nutrient entries.

---

# What I need from you to finish exactly (for all 25)
Please provide either:
1) the full JSON export (preferred), or  
2) for each of the 25 foods: the `fdcId`, `description`, `brandOwner`, and the full `foodNutrients[]` array.

Once I have that, I will return:
- A complete 25-row nutrition summary table (macros per 100 g)
- Sugar:fiber ratio best/worst (handling fiber=0 correctly)
- Full protein ranking (25 items) + exact range
- Iron and calcium leaders
- Average sodium across all 25 + lists >500 and <200 mg
- GM vs non-GM averages (calories, sugar, fiber, protein)
- Count of products with Vitamin D %DV + range + top product

If you paste the JSON, tell me whether you want me to **deduplicate multi-context nutrient blocks** by preferring `LCGA` per-100g entries (recommended).
