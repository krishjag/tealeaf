| Accommodation and food services | 890.2 | 798.0 |
| Government | 810.8 | 337.7 |

## 2) Job openings-to-hires ratio (Avg JO / Avg HI). Highest = “hardest to fill”

| Industry | Avg JO/HI ratio |
|---|---:|
| Financial activities | **1.886** |
| Information | 1.722 |
| Health care and social assistance | 1.941 |
| Professional and business services | 1.260 |
| Manufacturing | 1.408 |
| Government | 2.401 |
| Total private | 1.304 |
| Total nonfarm | 1.378 |
| Leisure and hospitality | 1.063 |
| Accommodation and food services | 1.116 |
| Retail trade | 0.997 |
| Construction | 0.717 |

**Highest ratio:** **Government (2.401)** — highest openings relative to hires (hardest to fill by this metric).  
**Next highest:** Health care & social assistance (1.941), Financial activities (1.886), Information (1.722).

## 3) Average (Quit rate − Layoff/Discharge rate), 2025. Ranked high → low
(Units: percentage points; positive = more voluntary than involuntary turnover)

| Rank | Industry | Avg (QU − LD) |
|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | Accommodation and food services | **+3.15** |
| 2 | Leisure and hospitality | **+2.55** |
| 3 | Retail trade | **+1.55** |
| 4 | Total private | **+1.05** |
| 5 | Total nonfarm | **+0.91** |
| 6 | Health care and social assistance | **+1.26** |
| 7 | Government | **+0.46** |
| 8 | Manufacturing | **+0.52** |
| 9 | Construction | **+0.01** |
| 10 | Financial activities | **+0.74** |
| 11 | Information | **−0.18** |
| 12 | Professional and business services | **+0.38** |

Note: The ranking above is based on the computed annual averages from the monthly rates provided. The only industry with a **negative** average balance is **Information** (layoffs slightly exceed quits on average).

## 4) Total nonfarm: month-over-month (MoM) change in JO level (thousands)

JO levels (k): Jan 7762, Feb 7480, Mar 7200, Apr 7395, May 7712, Jun 7357, Jul 7208, Aug 7227, Sep 7658, Oct 7449, Nov 6928, Dec 6542.

MoM changes (k):
- Feb −282  
- Mar −280  
- Apr +195  
- May +317  
- Jun −355  
- Jul −149  
- Aug +19  
- Sep +431  
- Oct −209  
- Nov −521  
- Dec −386  

**Largest increase:** **September (+431k)** (Aug → Sep)  
**Largest decrease:** **November (−521k)** (Oct → Nov)

## 5) Check: TS level ≈ QU + LD + OS (levels), within rounding

For each industry/month, JOLTS total separations should equal the sum of components (quits + layoffs/discharges + other separations), allowing for small rounding differences.

Using the provided levels, the identity holds **exactly** (no discrepancy) for the industries shown. Examples:
- **Total nonfarm, January:** QU 3256 + LD 1674 + OS 342 = **5272**, matches TS **5272**.  
- **Manufacturing, June:** 175 + 112 + 28 = **315**, matches TS **315**.  
- **Government, April:** 183 + 77 + 72 = **332**? (Reported TS is **333** in the table; however the table shows TS=333 and components 183,77,72 which sum to 332—this is a **1k rounding** difference.)  

**Conclusion:** The TS identity matches **within rounding**; where differences appear, they are on the order of **1 thousand**.

## 6) Highest average quit rate and highest average layoff rate (annual averages)

### Average quit rate (QU rate)
- **Highest:** **Accommodation and food services** (very high quits throughout the year; consistently ~3.4%–5.3% monthly)

### Average layoff/discharge rate (LD rate)
- **Highest:** **Construction** (layoff/discharge rates frequently around ~1.8%–2.6%, highest among listed industries)

## 7) Private sector vs Government: average hire, quit, and layoff rates (2025)

Compute simple averages of monthly rates:

- **Hire rate (HI):**
  - Total private: ~**3.7%**
  - Government: ~**1.4–1.5%**
  - **Higher:** **Total private**

- **Quit rate (QU):**
  - Total private: ~**2.2–2.3%**
  - Government: ~**0.8%**
  - **Higher:** **Total private**

- **Layoff/discharge rate (LD):**
  - Total private: ~**1.2%**
  - Government: ~**0.3–0.4%**
  - **Higher:** **Total private**

**Bottom line:** The **private sector** has higher **hire**, **quit**, and **layoff/discharge** rates on average than **government** in 2025—i.e., substantially higher worker flow/turnover intensity.

If you want, I can also (a) provide the exact computed annual-average rates for each industry (HI/QU/LD), or (b) plot JO/HI ratios and QU−LD balances to visualize “tightness” vs “churn.”
