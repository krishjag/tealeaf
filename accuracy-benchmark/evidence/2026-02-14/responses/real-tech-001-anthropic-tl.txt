## 2. Severity Distribution

| Severity | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **HIGH** | 12 | 30% |
| **MEDIUM** | 28 | 70% |
| LOW | 0 | 0% |
| CRITICAL | 0 | 0% |

The dataset is dominated by MEDIUM severity vulnerabilities, with a significant portion (30%) rated HIGH.

## 3. CWE Type Analysis

| CWE | Count | Avg CVSS | Description |
|-----|-------|----------|-------------|
| **CWE-416** | 7 | **7.33** | Use After Free |
| CWE-125 | 4 | 7.10 | Out-of-bounds Read |
| CWE-672 | 1 | 7.00 | Operation on Resource after Expiration |
| CWE-362 | 2 | 6.65 | Race Condition |
| CWE-667 | 3 | 6.00 | Improper Locking |
| CWE-787 | 2 | 5.80 | Out-of-bounds Write |
| NVD-CWE-noinfo | 5 | 5.50 | Insufficient Information |
| CWE-476 | 6 | 5.50 | NULL Pointer Dereference |
| CWE-401 | 4 | 5.45 | Memory Leak |
| CWE-Other | 2 | 5.50 | Other |
| CWE-770 | 1 | 5.50 | Allocation without Limits |
| CWE-369 | 1 | 5.50 | Divide By Zero |

**CWE-416 (Use After Free) has the highest average severity at 7.33**, appearing in 7 CVEs, making it the most critical weakness class in this dataset.

## 4. Attack Vector Analysis

| Attack Vector | Count | Percentage |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| **LOCAL** | 38 | 95% |
| **NETWORK** | 2 | 5% |
| ADJACENT_NETWORK | 0 | 0% |
| PHYSICAL | 0 | 0% |

**95% of vulnerabilities require local access**, indicating these are primarily privilege escalation or local denial-of-service vulnerabilities. Only 5% are remotely exploitable (CVE-2021-47075, CVE-2023-52511).

## 5. Broadest Version Range Affected

**CVE-2023-52507** affects the broadest range:
- **8 version ranges** spanning from kernel 3.2 to 6.6-rc5
- Total span: ~3.4+ kernel versions

**CVE-2022-48627** is also significant:
- Affects kernels from **3.7 to 6.6-rc6**
- Includes a wide range with critical memory corruption (CWE-787)

Most CVEs affect 4-6 concurrent version ranges, targeting stable branches (5.4.x, 5.10.x, 5.15.x, 6.1.x) plus recent development kernels.

## 6. Exploitability vs Impact Analysis

**Exploitability Scores:**
- Average: **1.78** (mostly 1.8, some 1.0, two at 3.9)
- The low exploitability reflects LOCAL attack vector requirements

**Impact Scores:**
- Average: **4.35** (range: 1.4 to 5.9)
- Most common: 3.6 and 5.9

**Impact-to-Exploitability Ratio: 2.44:1**

This indicates that while these vulnerabilities are relatively difficult to exploit (requiring local access), they have moderate to high impact when successfully exploited, often resulting in privilege escalation or system crashes.

## 7. Reference Tag Analysis

Counting all references across 40 CVEs:

| Tag Type | Count | CVEs with Tag | Percentage |
|----------|-------|---------------|------------|
| **Patch** | 292 | 40 | **100%** |
| Mailing List | 2 | 2 | 5% |
| (no tags) | 4 | 2 | - |

**Key Finding: 100% of CVEs include Patch references**, typically pointing to git.kernel.org with multiple patches per CVE (average ~7 patches per CVE) covering different kernel version branches.

## Summary Insights

1. **Memory safety dominates**: Use-after-free (CWE-416), NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476), and memory leaks (CWE-401) account for 42.5% of vulnerabilities

2. **Local attack surface**: The overwhelming LOCAL attack vector (95%) suggests these vulnerabilities are primarily discovered through internal code audits rather than external attack scenarios

3. **Comprehensive patching**: Every CVE has multiple patch commits, demonstrating thorough backporting across supported kernel versions (5.4 LTS, 5.10 LTS, 5.15 LTS, 6.1 LTS, and mainline)

4. **Moderate severity cluster**: 70% MEDIUM severity with 5.5 CVSS clustering suggests systematic code quality issues rather than critical security flaws

5. **Impact exceeds exploitability**: The 2.44:1 ratio indicates these are serious vulnerabilities that require privileged access but can cause significant damage (denial of service, information disclosure, privilege escalation)
