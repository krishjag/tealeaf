## 1) Highest/lowest average Job Openings rate (JO rate)

I averaged the **monthly JO rates (percent of employment)** over 2025 for each industry.

### Highest average JO rate (top 3)
1. **Accommodation & food services (720000): ~5.93%**
2. **Leisure & hospitality (700000): ~5.73%**
3. **Health care & social assistance (620000): ~5.68%**  
   *(close runner-up: Professional & business services ~5.45%)*

### Lowest average JO rate (bottom 3)
1. **Construction (230000): ~2.90%**
2. **Financial activities (510099): ~4.18%**
3. **Government (900000): ~3.33%**  
   *(next-lowest: Manufacturing ~3.23%)*

**Interpretation (labor demand):**  
High JO rates in **hospitality/food** and **health care** point to persistently strong vacancy pressure—often reflecting high turnover, rapid replacement needs, and/or difficulty matching workers to jobs (wages, schedules, credentials, working conditions). Low JO rates in **construction** (in this dataset) and **government** suggest comparatively less vacancy pressure (or tighter requisition control/longer hiring pipelines in government), while **financial activities** looks relatively cooler on vacancy intensity versus most other private sectors shown.

## 2) Labor market churn by industry (annual average)
Definition you gave: **churn = (hires level + total separations level) / 2**, computed monthly then averaged over 2025. Units are **thousands of workers**.

Ranked **highest → lowest churn**:

1. **Total nonfarm (000000): ~5,278**
2. **Total private (100000): ~4,921**
3. **Professional & business services (540099): ~1,017**
4. **Leisure & hospitality (700000): ~952**
5. **Retail trade (440000): ~595**
6. **Health care & social assistance (620000): ~695**
7. **Accommodation & food services (720000): ~792**
8. **Manufacturing (300000): ~314**
9. **Government (900000): ~331**
10. **Construction (230000): ~340**
11. **Financial activities (510099): ~207**
12. **Information (510000): ~87**

Notes:
- The “Total” series dominate mechanically because they aggregate industries.
- Among the sector series, **PBS and Leisure/Hospitality** show the largest worker-flow volumes; **Information** is the smallest in level churn (small industry employment base and lower flows).

## 3) Net hiring rate (avg hire rate − avg total separations rate)

I averaged monthly **HI rate** and **TS rate** (percent of employment), then took the difference.

### Positive net hiring (growing)
- **Government:** ~**+0.12 pp** (1.43% − 1.32%)
- **Health care & social assistance:** ~**+0.30 pp** (3.10% − 2.80%)
- **Total nonfarm:** ~**+0.08 pp** (3.35% − 3.27%)
- **Total private:** ~**+0.11 pp** (3.68% − 3.57%)

### Negative net hiring (shrinking)
- **Construction:** ~**−0.05 pp**
- **Manufacturing:** ~**−0.11 pp**
- **Retail trade:** ~**−0.03 pp**
- **Information:** ~**−0.15 pp**
- **Financial activities:** ~**−0.03 pp**
- **Professional & business services:** ~**−0.10 pp**
- **Leisure & hospitality:** ~**−0.08 pp**
- **Accommodation & food services:** ~**−0.07 pp**

**Interpretation:**  
Only **health care** and **government** show clearly positive net growth in this 2025 flow-rate accounting. Many high-turnover sectors (hospitality, PBS) can have **high hiring and high separations simultaneously**, yielding near-zero or slightly negative net.

## 4) Leisure & hospitality vs Professional & business services (average rates, all 6 metrics)

Averages over 2025 (rates are % of employment):

| Metric (rate) | Leisure & hospitality (700000) | Prof & business services (540099) |
|---|---:|---:|
| **JO** | ~**5.73** | ~**5.45** |
| **HI** | ~**5.72** | ~**4.58** |
| **TS** | ~**5.80** | ~**4.68** |
| **QU** | ~**4.01** | ~**2.33** |
| **LD** | ~**1.40** | ~**2.01** |
| **OS** | ~**0.12** | ~**0.23** |

**Structural differences in workforce dynamics**
- **Much higher quit intensity in Leisure/Hospitality** (QU ~4.0% vs ~2.3%): classic high-churn, lower-tenure labor market with frequent voluntary moves.
- **PBS has higher layoff/discharge intensity** (LD ~2.0% vs ~1.4%): more employer-driven separations relative to Leisure/Hospitality, consistent with project/cycle sensitivity and restructuring.
- **Leisure/Hospitality hires and separations are both extremely high** (HI and TS near ~5.7–5.8%), indicating a “high-velocity” labor market where staffing is continuously replenished.
- **Other separations** are small in both, but **PBS is higher** (OS ~0.23% vs ~0.12%), consistent with more retirements/transfers in a higher-tenure workforce.

## 5) Construction seasonality (hires level)

Construction hires levels (thousands) by month:
Jan 346, Feb 347, **Mar 306**, Apr 364, May 358, Jun 348, Jul 331, Aug 353, Sep 355, Oct 331, Nov 335, Dec 347.

- **Highest hires:** **April (364k)**
- **Lowest hires:** **March (306k)**
- **Range:** **364 − 306 = 58k**

---

## 6) Separation composition: quits vs layoffs vs other (levels)

For each industry, I summed levels over 12 months and computed shares of **total separations (TS)**:

### Shares (approx.)
- **Total nonfarm:** Quits **~61.4%**, Layoffs **~32.4%**, Other **~6.2%**
- **Total private:** Quits **~61.7%**, Layoffs **~33.2%**, Other **~5.1%**
- **Construction:** Quits **~44.7%**, Layoffs **~50.4%**, Other **~4.9%**
- **Manufacturing:** Quits **~56.6%**, Layoffs **~36.1%**, Other **~7.3%**
- **Retail trade:** Quits **~68.5%**, Layoffs **~28.4%**, Other **~3.1%**
- **Information:** Quits **~43.6%**, Layoffs **~47.6%**, Other **~8.8%**
- **Financial activities:** Quits **~61.1%**, Layoffs **~29.0%**, Other **~9.9%**
- **Professional & business services:** Quits **~52.0%**, Layoffs **~43.0%**, Other **~5.0%**
- **Health care & social assistance:** Quits **~70.1%**, Layoffs **~24.4%**, Other **~5.5%**
- **Leisure & hospitality:** Quits **~72.0%**, Layoffs **~25.5%**, Other **~2.5%**
- **Accommodation & food services:** Quits **~75.4%**, Layoffs **~22.3%**, Other **~2.3%**
- **Government:** Quits **~56.4%**, Layoffs **~25.5%**, Other **~18.1%**

### Highest quit share
- **Accommodation & food services:** **~75%** of separations are quits (highest)

### Highest layoff/discharge share
- **Construction:** **~50%** layoffs/discharges (highest)  
  *(Information is also very high at ~48%.)*

## 7) “Ratio of unemployed persons implied by job openings” (Total nonfarm)

To compute a **job-openings-to-unemployed ratio** (or its inverse), you need **unemployment level (number of unemployed persons)** from CPS for the same months (or at least an annual average). The JOLTS file you provided includes **job openings**, but **no unemployment counts or unemployment rate**.

What I *can* provide from your data:
- **Average Total nonfarm job openings level (2025):**  
  Sum JO levels = 88,418 (thousands) over 12 months ⇒ average **~7,368k** openings.

To finish the ratio you asked for, you’d do one of these:
- **Openings per unemployed:** \( \text{JO} / U \)
- **Unemployed per opening:** \( U / \text{JO} \)

If you share either:
- annual average **unemployed level (U)** in thousands, or
- annual average **unemployment rate** plus an employment/labor force level consistent with that rate,

…I’ll compute the ratio and interpret tightness (values >1 openings per unemployed indicate a very tight market; <1 indicates slack).

If you want, tell me whether you want **JO/U** or **U/JO**, and whether to use **annual average** or a specific month (e.g., December 2025).
