I can’t complete the requested **across-all-25** calculations from what’s shown in the prompt because the `foods:@table` content is **truncated** (it cuts off partway through the 25 items), and several products shown (notably **Cheerios** and **Boo Berry**) contain **multiple duplicated nutrient panels** within the same `foodNutrients` array (likely “as prepared with milk” + “unprepared” + “per 100g” variants). If I compute “per 100g” without the full dataset and without disambiguating duplicates, the rankings/averages and “best/worst” calls would be unreliable.

That said, I can do two things right now:

1) Provide a **robust extraction/cleaning method** that will produce the exact outputs you asked for once you paste/upload the full JSON for all 25 foods.  
2) Provide **partial results** for the foods that are fully visible and have a single clear per-100g panel (e.g., Bauducco cookie cereal, belVita, Holy Crap, several Chex/Trix/Total items).

Below is the analysis plan + what I can already determine from the visible records.

---

## A. How I will extract the correct “per 100g” nutrients (important due to duplicates)

For each food:

- Identify candidate nutrient entries by `nutrientId`:
  - Energy kcal: **1008**
  - Protein: **1003**
  - Total fat: **1004**
  - Carbohydrate: **1005**
  - Total sugars: **2000**
  - Fiber: **1079**
  - Calcium: **1087**
  - Iron: **1089**
  - Sodium: **1093**
  - Vitamin D: typically **1114** (µg) or sometimes **1110** (IU) depending on label style

- **Choose the “per 100g” panel**:
  - Prefer entries where `derivationCode` indicates per 100g directly (often `LCGA` “Given … per 100 unit measure”) **or**
  - If `servingSizeUnit` is `g` and `servingSize` is 100, then `LCSA/LCCS` values are already per 100g.
  - If multiple panels exist, select the panel whose macro set (protein/fat/carb/energy) is internally consistent and matches the product’s `servingSize` logic.
  - If there are multiple complete panels, I will:
    - pick the one with `derivationCode` in {`LCGA`, `LCCS`, `LCSA`} that best matches “unprepared/per 100g”
    - and/or deduplicate by taking the **mode** of values for each nutrientId within a tolerance, or selecting the **maximum completeness** panel.

This is necessary because, for example, **Cheerios** in your excerpt includes 3 macro panels (one looks like cereal-only per 100g, another looks like “with milk” per 100g, etc.).

## 1) Nutrition summary table (per 100g)

### Partial table (only products in the excerpt with a single clear per-100g panel)
Values are per 100g as displayed.

| Product (fdcId) | Brand owner | kcal | Protein (g) | Fat (g) | Carb (g) | Sugars (g) | Fiber (g) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| BAUDUCCO Breakfast Cookie Milk & Cereals (1880521) | Trusouth Oil LLC | 424 | 9.09 | 13.6 | 63.6 | 21.2 | 12.1 |
| belVita Biscuits Breakfast Cereals & Milk (769904) | (blank) | ~ | 7.9 | 14.5 | ~ | 20.0 | 6.5 |
| belVita Biscuits Breakfast Cereals & Milk (770738) | (blank) | ~ | 7.9 | 14.5 | ~ | 20.0 | 6.5 |
| “Breakfast Pack Cereal” (2560946) | General Mills | 394 | 9.09 | 4.55 | 81.8 | 33.3 | 6.1 |
| Holy Crap Dragons Blend (1869223) | Unisa Fisher LLC | 464 | 21.4 | 21.4 | 42.9 | 10.7 | 14.3 |
| Chocolate Chex (2746533) | General Mills | 419 | 4.65 | 8.14 | 81.4 | 25.6 | 4.7 |
| Cinnamon Chex (2747410) | General Mills | 400 | 5.0 | 8.75 | 82.5 | 20.0 | 5.0 |
| Cinnamon Chex (2746532) | General Mills | 400 | 5.0 | 8.75 | 82.5 | 20.0 | 5.0 |
| Rice Chex (2746531) | General Mills | 375 | 7.5 | 2.5 | 87.5 | 7.5 | 5.0 |
| Total cereal (2746605) | General Mills | 350 | 7.5 | 2.5 | 82.5 | 15.0 | 10.0 |
| Trix Loaded (2720715) | General Mills | 422 | 4.61 | 13.6 | 75.0 | 29.4 | 5.01 |
| Trix Mini (2720722) | General Mills | 390 | 5.49 | 6.15 | 84.5 | 28.5 | 4.22 |
| Trix Mini (2720723) | General Mills | 390 | 5.49 | 6.15 | 84.5 | 28.5 | 4.22 |

Notes:
- belVita entries in the excerpt don’t show Energy/Carb explicitly (they show starch, sugars, etc.). In the full dataset, Energy and total carb may exist; if not, I’ll leave them null.
- Many other General Mills cereals are present but not fully visible in the excerpt.

Once you provide the full JSON, I’ll output the complete 25-row table.

## 2) Sugar-to-fiber ratio (sugars g / fiber g)

Using the partial set above:

- BAUDUCCO: 21.2 / 12.1 = **1.75**
- Breakfast Pack Cereal: 33.3 / 6.1 = **5.46**
- Holy Crap Dragons Blend: 10.7 / 14.3 = **0.75**
- Chocolate Chex: 25.6 / 4.7 = **5.45**
- Cinnamon Chex: 20 / 5 = **4.00**
- Rice Chex: 7.5 / 5 = **1.50**
- Total: 15 / 10 = **1.50**
- Trix Loaded: 29.4 / 5.01 = **5.87**
- Trix Mini: 28.5 / 4.22 = **6.75**

**Best (lowest) ratio (from visible items):**
- **HOLY CRAP Dragons Blend (1869223): ~0.75**

**Worst (highest) ratio (from visible items):**
- **Trix Mini (2720722 / 2720723): ~6.75**

These “best/worst” are **not final** until all 25 are computed.

---

## 3) Rank all 25 by protein per 100g + range

I can’t rank all 25 without the missing foods. From the visible subset, highest protein is:

- **HOLY CRAP Dragons Blend: 21.4 g/100g** (very high; chia/hemp base)

Lowest in the visible subset:
- **Trix Loaded: 4.61 g/100g** (Chocolate Chex is 4.65)

Partial range (visible only): **21.4 − 4.61 = 16.79 g/100g**

With the full dataset, I’ll produce:
- full 25-item ranking
- exact max/min and range

---

## 4) Micronutrients comparison: iron and calcium

From visible items (per 100g):

- **Most iron (visible):**  
  - **Total cereal (2746605): Iron 45 mg/100g**  
  - Rice Chex: 36 mg/100g  
  - Cheerios shown elsewhere has 32.3 mg/100g in one panel, but it’s in a duplicated multi-panel record.

- **Most calcium (visible):**
  - Chocolate Cheerios (not fully summarized above but visible): Ca 361 mg/100g  
  - Cookie Crisp: Ca 361 mg/100g  
  - Several GM cereals cluster around 325–361 mg/100g  
  - Cheerios: 333 mg/100g (in one panel)

So, **in the visible subset**:
- **Most iron-fortified:** **Total (45 mg/100g)**
- **Most calcium:** **361 mg/100g** (tie among some GM cereals shown)

Final answers require scanning all 25.

---

## 5) Average sodium + products >500 mg and <200 mg (per 100g)

I can’t compute the **average across all 25** without the missing items, but I can flag thresholds from visible items:

**Exceed 500 mg/100g (visible):**
- Breakfast Pack Cereal: **636 mg**
- Chocolate Chex: **581 mg**
- Cinnamon Chex: **575 mg**
- Rice Chex: **775 mg**
- Lucky Charms (visible later): **611 mg**
- Cookie Crisp: **528 mg**
- Trix Mini: **505 mg**
- Cheerios cup: **500 mg** (equals 500; your criterion is “exceed”, so not included unless you want ≥500)

**Below 200 mg/100g (visible):**
- HOLY CRAP Dragons Blend: **0 mg**
- (Some “with milk” panels in Cheerios/Boo Berry show ~116–121 mg sodium, but those are likely prepared forms; needs disambiguation.)

Once full data is available, I’ll compute:
- mean sodium across all 25 (and optionally median, since sodium is skewed)
- exact lists for >500 and <200

---

## 6) General Mills vs non–General Mills averages (kcal, sugar, fiber, protein)

Not computable accurately without all 25 items.

From what’s visible, General Mills cereals tend to be:
- ~350–422 kcal/100g
- sugars often 7.5–33 g/100g depending on product
- fiber 4–11 g/100g
- protein ~4.6–12.8 g/100g (depending on panel)

Non-General Mills visible:
- BAUDUCCO cookie cereal: 424 kcal, sugars 21.2, fiber 12.1, protein 9.09
- HOLY CRAP: 464 kcal, sugars 10.7, fiber 14.3, protein 21.4
- belVita: sugars 20, fiber 6.5, protein 7.9 (energy not shown in excerpt)

With full data, I’ll compute group means and also provide **n** per group.

---

## 7) Vitamin D %DV presence + range + highest

Not computable across all 25 from the truncated excerpt, but I can confirm:

- Many General Mills cereals include **Vitamin D (D2 + D3)** nutrientId **1114** with `percentDailyValue` typically **20%** (and some cups show **15%**, some “with milk” panels show **30%**).
- Nature’s Promise biscuits show Vitamin D as **1110 (IU)** with %DV **0**.

From visible GM “unprepared” panels:
- Common %DV: **20%**
From visible “prepared/with milk” panels embedded in Cheerios/Boo Berry:
- %DV up to **30%**

So, in the excerpt, Vitamin D %DV range observed is **0% to 30%**, but the **count** and **true max** across all 25 require full scan.

# What I need from you to finish precisely
Please provide either:
1) the **full `foods` JSON array** for all 25 products (preferred), or  
2) a file upload / paste of the API response, or  
3) confirm you want me to compute using **only the excerpted foods** (and accept that it won’t be “all 25”).

Once I have the complete data, I’ll return:
- the full 25-row nutrition summary table
- best/worst sugar:fiber ratio
- full protein ranking + range
- iron & calcium leaders
- average sodium + threshold lists
- GM vs non-GM averages
- Vitamin D %DV count + range + top product(s)
