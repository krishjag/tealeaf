# Analysis of Manhattan's Highest-Value Properties

## 1. Zoning District Distribution

**Zoning Frequency (zonedist1):**
- **C6 variants**: 12 properties (C6-4: 3, C6-6: 3, C6-5.5: 2, C6-7: 1, C6-6.5: 1, C6-4.5: 1, C6-6: 1)
- **C5 variants**: 8 properties (C5-3: 4, C5-2.5: 3, C5-2: 1)
- **R7-2 and R8**: 3 properties (residential)
- **M zones**: 2 properties (M2-3, M1-5)
- **PARK**: 1 property

**Key Findings:**
- **Commercial dominance**: 20 of 30 properties (67%) are in C5/C6 commercial zones, which permit high-density mixed-use development with FAR typically 10-15+
- **Manufacturing zones**: Only 2 properties:
  - Block 680 (Convention Center) - M2-3
  - Block 739 (111 8th Ave/Google building) - M1-5
- **Residential zones**: 3 properties (all subsidized housing developments)
- **Special Districts**: Many have "MiD" (Midtown) or "HY" (Hudson Yards) special district overlays, allowing for additional density bonuses

The C6 zones allow the highest intensity commercial development (FAR 15+), explaining why they dominate this high-value dataset.

## 2. Building Age Profile

**Properties by Decade Built:**

**1930s (3 properties):**
- Empire State Building (1931) - $534M
- Rockefeller Center buildings (1932, 1937) - $498M, $619M
- Presbyterian Hospital (1930) - $460M
- **Average: $527.8M**

**1940s (1 property):**
- Stuyvesant Town (1945) - $792M
- **Average: $792M**

**1960s (5 properties):**
- Average: $570M
- Range: $449M - $791M

**1970s (7 properties):**
- Average: $481M
- Range: $437M - $619M

**1980s (1 property):**
- 388 Greenwich St (1989) - $520M

**1990s (1 property):**
- American Museum of Natural History (1998) - $474M

**2000s (5 properties):**
- Average: $698M
- Includes One World Trade Center (2009) - $1.67B (highest)
- Time Warner Center (2004) - $794M

**2010s (7 properties):**
- Average: $648M
- Range: $452M - $931M
- Includes Hudson Yards towers

**Key Insight:** There's **NO simple correlation** between age and value. The 1940s property (Stuyvesant Town) is extremely valuable due to its massive 8,764 residential units. However, the highest value is 2009 (One World Trade Center). The 1930s Art Deco landmarks (Empire State, Rockefeller Center) maintain exceptional values due to location and iconic status. Post-2000 buildings average higher ($673M) than 1970s-1980s buildings ($481M), reflecting modern construction standards and amenities.

## 3. Area Composition Analysis

**Mixed-Use Properties (3+ area types >0):**

1. **One World Trade Center** - Most mixed:
   - Office: 80%, Retail: 9%, Other: 11%
   
2. **Time Warner Center** (Block 1049):
   - Office: 37%, Retail: 20%, Residential: 21%, Garage: 5%, Other: 6%
   - Most balanced mix

3. **Stuyvesant Town** (Block 972):
   - Residential: 94%, Retail: 1%, Garage: 5%

4. **One Beacon Court** (Block 1313):
   - Office: 66%, Retail: 11%, Residential: 22%

**Single-Purpose Properties:**

**Pure Office (12 properties):**
- 388 Greenwich St, 111 8th Ave, 50 Hudson Yards, 509 W 34th St, 9 W 57th St, 1211 6th Ave, etc.
- Typical: 95-100% office space

**Pure Commercial/Convention:**
- Javits Convention Center: Storage 43%, Other 57%

**Pure Cultural:**
- American Museum of Natural History: 91% "other area" (exhibition space)

**Pure Residential:**
- Roosevelt Island (Block 1373): 78% residential

**Key Finding:** Only 4 properties are truly mixed-use. Most are **hyper-specialized** - either pure office towers or pure residential. This reflects Manhattan's land economics: highest-value properties optimize for single use at scale rather than mixed-use.

## 4. Floor Plate Analysis

**Average Floor Plate Size (bldgarea/numfloors):**

**Largest Floor Plates:**
1. **Javits Convention Center** - 1,015,149 sf/floor (4 floors, convention halls)
2. **American Museum of Natural History** - 194,323 sf/floor (7 floors)
3. **Presbyterian Hospital** - 167,888 sf/floor (22 floors)
4. **111 8th Ave** (Google) - 127,176 sf/floor (17 floors, former factory)
5. **One World Trade Center** - 86,217 sf/floor (104 floors)

**Smallest Floor Plates:**
1. **One Vanderbilt** - 27,969 sf/floor (60 floors, slender tower)
2. **601 Lexington** - 27,567 sf/floor (60 floors)
3. **Empire State Building** - 27,575 sf/floor (102 floors)
4. **767 Fifth Ave** - 36,496 sf/floor (50 floors)

**Pattern by Building Class:**
- **O4 (Office buildings)**: Average 40,000-50,000 sf/floor
- **RC (Residential condos)**: Average 30,000-40,000 sf/floor (slender luxury towers)
- **P9, P7, I1 (Public facilities)**: >100,000 sf/floor (horizontal programs)
- **D4, D7 (Multi-family residential)**: Varies widely

**Key Insight:** Building class correlates strongly with floor plate. Modern office towers (O4) target 40-50k sf for efficient floorplates. Luxury residential (RC) uses smaller plates for better light/views. Institutional/public buildings prioritize large horizontal floors. Pre-war landmarks have smaller plates due to structural constraints.

## 6. Lot Coverage Analysis

**Lot Coverage Ratio = (bldgfront × bldgdepth) / lotarea**

**Highest Coverage (near 100%):**
1. **111 8th Ave** - 100% (207×800 / 165,200) - full block coverage
2. **Stuyvesant Town** - 103% (irregular, multiple buildings)
3. **Roosevelt Island** - 97% (horizontal campus)
4. **250 W 34th St** - 100% (647×197 / 127,966)

**Lowest Coverage:**
1. **One World Trade Center** - 4.7% (200×198 / 833,945) - huge plaza
2. **Javits Center** - 49% (1227×389 / 962,250)
3. **One Vanderbilt** - 98% (very efficient)
4. **51 E 42nd St** - 98%

**Patterns:**
- **Pre-war buildings** (Empire State, Rockefeller): 85-95% coverage with setbacks
- **Modern towers**: 95-100% coverage of lot, using height for FAR
- **Campus developments**: Lower coverage (WTC, hospitals, museums)
- **Mid-block sites**: Nearly 100% coverage
- **Full block sites**: Often include plazas/open space

**Key Insight:** Most high-value properties maximize lot coverage (>90%), achieving density through height rather than footprint. Exceptions are government/institutional projects with plaza requirements or campus layouts.
