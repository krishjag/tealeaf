## 4. Attack Vector Distribution

| Attack Vector | Count | Percentage |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| **LOCAL** | 38 | 95.0% |
| **NETWORK** | 2 | 5.0% |
| **ADJACENT_NETWORK** | 0 | 0.0% |
| **PHYSICAL** | 0 | 0.0% |

**Local vs Network Access**: 95% require local access, only 5% are exploitable over network.

## 5. Broadest Kernel Version Range Affected

**CVE-2023-52522** (net: neigh_periodic_work store tearing):
- Affects versions **2.6.37 through 6.6-rc4**
- Span: ~15+ years of kernel versions
- Most comprehensive impact across the dataset

Other notable broad-range CVEs:
- **CVE-2023-52507**: 3.2 to 6.6-rc5
- **CVE-2022-48627**: 3.7 to 6.6-rc6

## 6. Exploitability vs Impact Analysis

- **Average Exploitability Score**: 1.66
- **Average Impact Score**: 4.63
- **Impact to Exploitability Ratio**: **2.79:1**

This indicates vulnerabilities have significantly higher impact potential (2.8x) compared to ease of exploitation, primarily due to local access requirements.

## 7. Reference Tag Analysis

| Reference Type | CVE Count | Percentage |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| **Patch** | 40 | 100.0% |
| **Mailing List** | 2 | 5.0% |
| **Vendor Advisory** | 0 | 0.0% |
| **Third Party Advisory** | 0 | 0.0% |

**Key Finding**: **100% of CVEs have Patch references**, indicating all vulnerabilities have been addressed with fixes in the stable kernel repositories (git.kernel.org). This demonstrates excellent response and remediation coverage for these kernel vulnerabilities.

## Summary Insights

1. **Severity Profile**: Moderate overall risk with 70% MEDIUM and 30% HIGH severity
2. **Attack Surface**: Heavily local (95%), reducing remote exploitation risk
3. **Primary Threats**: Memory safety issues dominate (Use-after-free, NULL pointers, memory leaks)
4. **Patch Availability**: Excellent - 100% patch coverage across all stable kernel branches
5. **Legacy Impact**: Some vulnerabilities affect kernels dating back over 15 years, highlighting importance of kernel updates
