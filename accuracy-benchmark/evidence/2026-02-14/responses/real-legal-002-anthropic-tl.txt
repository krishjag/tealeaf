| 2 | 2016-02-16 | Preliminary hearing 2/18/16 | Waupun Correctional |

| 16 | 2021-08-16 | Evidentiary hearing 9/10/21 | Green Bay Correctional |
| 17 | 2021-08-16 | Evidentiary hearing 9/10/21 | Wisconsin Secure Program Facility |
| 18 | 2021-08-17 | Evidentiary hearing 9/10/21 (writ) | Wisconsin Secure Program Facility |
| 19 | 2021-08-17 | Evidentiary hearing 9/10/21 (writ) | Green Bay Correctional |
| 20 | 2021-10-27 | Evidentiary hearing 11/29/21 | Green Bay Correctional |
| 21 | 2021-11-02 | Evidentiary hearing 11/29/21 (writ) | Green Bay Correctional |

### Pattern Analysis:

**What This Pattern Suggests:**

1. **Incarcerated Throughout Proceedings:** Ramirez was continuously incarcerated during the entire case (initially at Waupun, then Green Bay, finally Wisconsin Secure Program Facility)

2. **Administrative Burden:** Each court appearance required formal writ petition and order, demonstrating the procedural complexity of prosecuting an already-incarcerated defendant

3. **Inter-facility Transfers:** The defendant was moved between facilities:
   - **Waupun Correctional Institution** (initial appearances, 2016)
   - **Green Bay Correctional Institution** (2016-2022)
   - **Wisconsin Secure Program Facility** (2022-2025, maximum security)

4. **Heightened Security Status:** The final transfer to Wisconsin Secure Program Facility (supermax) suggests either classification as high-risk or placement in restrictive housing

5. **Video Appearances:** Multiple docket entries note appearances "via video conferencing," reducing but not eliminating transport requirements

6. **DOC Coordination Required:** Each writ required coordination between:
   - Circuit court
   - District Attorney's office
   - Department of Corrections
   - Facility administrators
   - Transport/security personnel

**Implication:** The habeas corpus pattern reveals this was a **secondary prosecution** of a defendant already serving time for other offense(s), with all the logistical complexities that entails. The consecutive sentencing language ("consecutive to any other sentence currently serving") confirms he was already under DOC custody when this incident occurred.

- At least **10 motions** to extend time filed with Court of Appeals:
  - 4 motions extending time to file postconviction motion
  - 4 motions extending time for circuit court to decide postconviction motion
  - 2 motions extending appellate briefing deadlines

### Motion Activity by Phase:

| Phase | Motion Count | Types | Winner |
|-------|-------------|-------|--------|
| **Pre-Trial (2016-2019)** | ~8-10 | Discovery, continuances, in limine, dismissal | Mixed (mostly procedural) |
| **Trial (Dec 2019)** | 0 | None | N/A |
| **Post-Trial (2019-2020)** | 0 | None | N/A |
| **Post-Conviction (2020-2023)** | ~15+ | Extensions, substantive speedy trial claims | **Defense (ultimate victory)** |

### Most Frequent Motion Types:

1. **Extension/Continuance Motions:** ~12+ (most common)
2. **Discovery Motions:** 2-3
3. **Substantive Merit Motions:** 4 (in limine, dismissal, postconviction ×2)
4. **Writs (Habeas Corpus):** 24 (technically petitions, not motions)

### Phase with Highest Motion Activity:

**POST-CONVICTION PHASE (2020-2023)** shows the most concentrated motion activity:
- Multiple extension motions
- Evidentiary hearings requiring scheduling
- Supplemental motions on remand
- Complex appellate coordination

This reflects the defendant's aggressive post-conviction litigation strategy, which ultimately succeeded in overturning the conviction.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS & SIGNIFICANCE

### 1. **Successful Speedy Trial Claim (Rare Outcome)**
Despite initial denial by circuit court, defendant's persistent litigation on speedy trial grounds ultimately prevailed at appellate level—demonstrating the potency of constitutional claims even after conviction.

### 2. **Decade-Long Case (2015-2025)**
- Offense to final disposition: **10 years, 4 months**
- Pre-trial delay alone: **3+ years**
- Post-conviction litigation: **5+ years**

### 3. **Incarceration Throughout**
Defendant was already serving another sentence when this incident occurred, remained incarcerated throughout all proceedings, and was housed at three different facilities including Wisconsin's supermax (WSPF).

### 4. **Reversal After Conviction**
The case represents a complete victory for the defense after:
- Guilty verdicts on both counts
- 15-year consecutive sentence imposed
- Initial postconviction motion denied
- Supplemental postconviction motion denied
- **Appellate courts ultimately reversed and ordered dismissal**

### 5. **Systemic Issues Illustrated**
The case highlights challenges in the criminal justice system:
- Managing cases involving already-incarcerated defendants
- Multiple continuances stretching speedy trial rights
- Resource constraints (video appearances, transport logistics)
- Tension between efficient case management and constitutional protections

### 6. **Effective Appellate Advocacy**
Attorney Jennifer Lohr's persistent post-conviction litigation strategy, including multiple extension requests and supplemental briefing after remand, ultimately achieved complete reversal—a testament to thorough appellate practice.

---

**FINAL STATUS:** Case closed with conviction **REVERSED** and complaint **DISMISSED** per appellate court order. Defendant prevailed on constitutional speedy trial grounds after decade of litigation.
