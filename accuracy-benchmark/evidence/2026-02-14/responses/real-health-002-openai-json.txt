I can compute items (1)–(7) **only for the counties included in the JSON you provided**. Your prompt says “10 counties,” but the excerpt contains **9 counties** (King, Pierce, Spokane, Clark, Yakima, Whatcom, Benton, Island, Ferry, Garfield). Below are results for these **9**.

---

## 1) Percent of residents who are adults (18+)

Adult % = adult_population / population × 100

| County | Population | Adult pop | Adult % |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| King | 2,271,380 | 1,836,529 | 80.9% |
| Pierce | 928,696 | 716,813 | 77.2% |
| Spokane | 551,455 | 433,863 | 78.7% |
| Clark | 521,150 | 405,348 | 77.8% |
| Yakima | 256,643 | 183,160 | 71.4% |
| Whatcom | 231,919 | 189,784 | 81.8% |
| Benton | 215,219 | 159,518 | 74.1% |
| Island | 86,267 | 71,614 | 83.0% |
| Ferry | 7,497 | 6,217 | 82.9% |
| Garfield | 2,363 | 1,865 | 78.9% |

## 2) Composite “chronic disease burden” score (mean of 6 measures)
Average of: **ARTHRITIS, BPHIGH, DIABETES, CHD, COPD, STROKE** (all crude %).

| County | Chronic disease burden score |
|---|---:|
| King | 10.5 |
| Pierce | 13.7 |
| Spokane | 13.8 |
| Clark | 13.4 |
| Yakima | 14.9 |
| Whatcom | 12.6 |
| Benton | 13.1 |
| Island | 15.7 |
| Ferry | 19.9 |
| Garfield | 16.7 |

(Example: King = (19.4+26.7+7.3+4.0+3.4+2.3)/6 = **10.5**)

---

## 3) Rank counties by chronic disease burden (lowest → highest)

1. **King** — 10.5  
2. **Whatcom** — 12.6  
3. **Benton** — 13.1  
4. **Clark** — 13.4  
5. **Pierce** — 13.7  
6. **Spokane** — 13.8  
7. **Yakima** — 14.9  
8. **Island** — 15.7  
9. **Garfield** — 16.7  
10. **Ferry** — 19.9  

Highest burden in this set: **Ferry County**.

## 4) Disability (DISABLT): average disability prevalence per county + highest burden

DISABLT measures averaged: **COGNITION, DISABILITY, HEARING, INDEPLIVE, MOBILITY, SELFCARE, VISION**.

| County | Avg disability prevalence (DISABLT composite) |
|---|---:|
| King | 7.8 |
| Pierce | 11.4 |
| Spokane | 11.2 |
| Clark | 10.6 |
| Yakima | 13.8 |
| Whatcom | 11.0 |
| Benton | 11.1 |
| Island | 10.8 |
| Ferry | 15.4 |
| Garfield | 11.8 |

**Highest disability burden:** **Ferry County** (avg ≈ **15.4%** across disability indicators).

---

## 5) Preventive service utilization (PREVENT): highest rates

From the PREVENT measures shown:

- **Highest dental visit (DENTAL):** **King** — **71.8%**
- **Highest mammography (MAMMOUSE):** **Spokane** — **76.9%**
- **Highest cholesterol screening (CHOLSCREEN):** **Garfield** — **86.4%**

---

## 6) Population-weighted average obesity (OBESITY), weighted by adult_population

Weighted mean obesity = Σ(adult_pop × obesity%) / Σ(adult_pop)

Using the counties provided:

- Total adult population (sum): **4,002,848**
- Weighted average adult obesity prevalence: **~29.3%**

So, across these counties (weighted by adult population), **adult obesity ≈ 29.3%**.

---

## 7) For each category: measure with the highest overall average prevalence across counties

I computed simple (unweighted) averages across counties for each measure within a category (using measures present in your JSON).

### HLTHOUT (Health Outcomes)
Highest average prevalence: **BPHIGH (High blood pressure)** — avg **~32.9%**

### HLTHSTAT (Health Status)
Highest average prevalence: **GHLTH (Fair/poor self-rated health)** — avg **~18.1%**

### PREVENT (Prevention)
Highest average prevalence: **CHOLSCREEN (Cholesterol screening)** — avg **~83.6%**

### RISKBEH (Risk Behaviors)
Highest average prevalence: **SLEEP (Short sleep duration)** — avg **~31.5%**

### DISABLT (Disability)
Highest average prevalence: **DISABILITY (Any disability)** — avg **~29.9%**

### HRSN (Health-Related Social Needs)
Not computable from the excerpt: **no HRSN measures are included** in the provided county health_data.

If you paste the missing 10th county (or confirm the intended list), I can recompute everything for the full set of 10 and also compute category (HRSN) item #7.
