## 2. Severity Distribution

| Severity | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **HIGH** (7.0-8.9) | 12 | 30% |
| **MEDIUM** (4.0-6.9) | 28 | 70% |
| **LOW** (<4.0) | 0 | 0% |
| **CRITICAL** (9.0-10.0) | 0 | 0% |

## 3. CWE Analysis

| CWE | Description | Count | Avg Score | Notable |
|-----|-------------|-------|-----------|---------|
| **CWE-416** | Use After Free | 6 | 7.00 | High severity |
| **CWE-125** | Out-of-bounds Read | 4 | **7.10** | **Highest avg** |
| **CWE-476** | NULL Pointer Dereference | 5 | 5.50 | Most common technical |
| **CWE-401** | Memory Leak | 4 | 5.43 | |
| **CWE-787** | Out-of-bounds Write | 3 | 5.70 | |
| **CWE-667** | Improper Locking | 3 | 6.00 | |
| **CWE-362** | Race Condition | 2 | 6.65 | |
| **CWE-672** | Operation on Resource After Expiry | 1 | 7.00 | |
| **CWE-369** | Divide By Zero | 1 | 5.50 | |
| **CWE-770** | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 1 | 5.50 | |

**Key Finding**: CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) has the highest average severity at 7.1, followed closely by CWE-416 (Use After Free) at 7.0.

## 4. Attack Vector Analysis

| Attack Vector | Count | Percentage |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| **LOCAL (AV:L)** | 37 | 92.5% |
| **NETWORK (AV:N)** | 3 | 7.5% |
| **ADJACENT_NETWORK** | 0 | 0% |
| **PHYSICAL** | 0 | 0% |

**Critical Insight**: 92.5% of vulnerabilities require local access, indicating these are primarily privilege escalation or local DoS issues rather than remote exploitation vulnerabilities.

## 5. Broadest Kernel Version Ranges

**Top 3 CVEs by version range:**

1. **CVE-2023-52502** (nfc: llcp races)
   - Range: 3.6 → 6.6 RC5
   - **~3 years of kernel versions**

2. **CVE-2022-48627** (vt: memory overlap)
   - Range: 3.7 → 6.5.6 + multiple earlier branches
   - **~3 years of kernel versions**

3. **CVE-2023-52507** (nfc: nci protocol validation)
   - Range: 3.2 → 6.6 RC5
   - **~3.5+ years of kernel versions**

## 6. Exploitability vs Impact Scores

**Aggregated Analysis:**

| Metric | Average | Range |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Exploitability Score** | ~1.75 | 1.0 - 3.9 |
| **Impact Score** | ~4.15 | 1.4 - 5.9 |

**Impact-to-Exploitability Ratio**: ~2.37:1

**Interpretation**: 
- Impact scores are consistently higher than exploitability scores
- Most vulnerabilities (LOCAL access required) have exploitability ~1.8
- The few NETWORK vulnerabilities have exploitability ~3.9
- Ratio indicates these vulnerabilities have significant impact but moderate-to-low exploitability

## 7. Reference Analysis

**Reference Tag Distribution:**

| Tag Type | CVEs with Tag | Percentage |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| **Patch** | 40 | **100%** |
| **Mailing List** | 2 | 5% |
| **Vendor Advisory** | 0 | 0% |

**Key Findings:**
- **100% of CVEs have patch references** (typically 3-14 patches per CVE pointing to git.kernel.org)
- Average of 8.5 patch references per CVE
- Patches reference both mainline and stable kernel branches
- Only 2 CVEs reference Debian LTS mailing lists
- All patches are publicly available in the kernel git repository

**Most Referenced CVE**: CVE-2023-52502 with 14 patch references across multiple kernel versions

## Summary

This dataset represents typical Linux kernel vulnerability patterns:
- Predominantly **memory safety issues** (Use After Free, NULL pointer, OOB access)
- Mostly **local attack vectors** (92.5%)
- **All have available patches** 
- Moderate severity overall (70% MEDIUM, 30% HIGH)
- Affects multiple kernel versions, requiring coordinated patching across stable branches
