**Answer: Costco has the lowest leverage (strongest balance sheet) based on the provided data.**

## 7) Most free cash flow
**FCF (CFO − capex):**
- **Apple: $98.767B** (highest)
- Visa: $21.577B
- Qualcomm: $12.820B

## 8) Flags: concerning debt levels or negative free cash flow
- **Negative free cash flow:** **None** (all four are positive on the provided cash flow figures).
- **Concerning leverage (relative within this peer set):**
  - **Apple** stands out with **Debt/Equity = 1.34x** (meaning debt exceeds equity). Not necessarily distressed given massive CFO/FCF, but **highest balance-sheet leverage** of the group.
- **Data completeness flag (Costco):**
  - Costco’s **debt-to-equity may be understated** because the balance sheet extract shows long-term debt but does not show a current portion/short-term borrowings line item. If you want, I can recompute Costco total debt once those tags are provided (e.g., `LongTermDebtCurrent`, `DebtCurrent`, `ShortTermBorrowings`, etc.).
- **Interest coverage flag (Apple):**
  - Apple’s **interest coverage can’t be computed from the provided Income Statement items** because **interest expense isn’t included** in the extract.

If you’d like, I can present these in a compact table and/or compute an additional leverage view using **net debt** (debt minus cash & marketable securities) for a more credit-relevant comparison.
