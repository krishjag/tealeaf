## 1) Percent of residents who are adults (18+)
Calculated as: **adult_population / population × 100**

| Ferry | 7,497 | 6,217 | **82.93%** |
| Garfield | 2,363 | 1,865 | **78.92%** |

**Highest % adults:** Island (83.01%)  
**Lowest % adults:** Yakima (71.37%)

## 2) Composite “chronic disease burden” score (average of 6 measures)
Measures averaged (crude prevalence, %): **ARTHRITIS, BPHIGH, DIABETES, CHD, COPD, STROKE**  
Score = (sum of the 6 prevalences) / 6

| County | Chronic disease burden score |
|---|---:|
| King | **10.52** |
| Pierce | **13.70** |
| Spokane | **13.82** |
| Clark | **13.60** |
| Yakima | **14.25** |
| Whatcom | **12.60** |
| Benton | **13.08** |
| Island | **15.73** |
| Ferry | **19.87** |
| Garfield | **16.22** |

## 3) Rank counties by chronic disease burden (lowest → highest)
1. **King** (10.52)  
2. **Whatcom** (12.60)  
3. **Benton** (13.08)  
4. **Clark** (13.60)  
5. **Pierce** (13.70)  
6. **Spokane** (13.82)  
7. **Yakima** (14.25)  
8. **Island** (15.73)  
9. **Garfield** (16.22)  
10. **Ferry** (19.87)

## 4) Average disability prevalence (DISABLT) and highest disability burden
DISABLT measures averaged (7): **COGNITION, DISABILITY, HEARING, INDEPLIVE, MOBILITY, SELFCARE, VISION**

| County | Avg disability prevalence (7-measure mean) |
|---|---:|
| King | **7.77** |
| Pierce | **11.43** |
| Spokane | **11.19** |
| Clark | **10.56** |
| Yakima | **13.84** |
| Whatcom | **11.01** |
| Benton | **11.13** |
| Island | **10.76** |
| Ferry | **15.40** |
| Garfield | **11.71** |

**Highest disability burden:** **Ferry County** (15.40%)

## 5) Preventive service utilization leaders (PREVENT)
From the provided counties’ PREVENT measures:

- **Highest dental visit rate (DENTAL):** **King** — **71.8%**
- **Highest mammography rate (MAMMOUSE):** **Spokane** — **76.9%**
- **Highest cholesterol screening rate (CHOLSCREEN):** **Garfield** — **86.4%**

---

## 6) Population-weighted average obesity (OBESITY) across all 10 counties
Weighted by **adult_population**:

\[
\text{Weighted obesity}=\frac{\sum(\text{adult pop}_i \times \text{obesity}_i)}{\sum(\text{adult pop}_i)}
\]

- Total adult population (10 counties): **4,004,711**
- **Population-weighted average obesity:** **28.07%**

(Heavily influenced by King due to its large adult population and lower obesity prevalence.)

---

## 7) For each category, measure with the highest overall average prevalence across counties
Computed as the **simple mean of county prevalences** for each measure within a category, then selecting the maximum within that category.

### HLTHOUT (Health Outcomes)
- **HIGHCHOL (High cholesterol among ever screened)** — **35.84%** (highest average in HLTHOUT)

### HLTHSTAT (Health Status)
- **MHLTH (Frequent mental distress)** — **16.80%** (highest average in HLTHSTAT)

### PREVENT (Prevention)
- **CHOLSCREEN (Cholesterol screening)** — **83.77%** (highest average in PREVENT)

### RISKBEH (Health Risk Behaviors)
- **SLEEP (Short sleep duration)** — **31.51%** (highest average in RISKBEH)

### DISABLT (Disability)
- **DISABILITY (Any disability)** — **29.90%** (highest average in DISABLT)

### HRSN (Health-Related Social Needs)
- **Not computable from the provided excerpt**: no HRSN measure values were included for these counties, so an across-county average and “highest” HRSN measure cannot be determined from what’s shown.

If you want, I can also (a) add uncertainty-aware comparisons using the confidence intervals (e.g., flagging where county differences likely overlap), or (b) compute category-wide averages weighted by adult population rather than simple means.
