Appeal-related = docket entries whose description or text references **Court of Appeals**, **Supreme Court**, **appeal**, **notice of appeal**, **remand**, **remittitur**, **transmittal of record**, **acknowledgment from appellate courts**, etc.

- **Appeal-related entries:** **33**
- **Total docket entries (all years):** **185**

## 6) Receivables calculations (due, paid, balance, % collected)

Receivables show one item:

- **Amount due:** 761.00  
- **Paid:** 352.00  
- **Balance due (remaining):** 0.00 (WCCA field shows balanceDue = 0.0)  
- **Amount due vs. paid gap:** 761.00 − 352.00 = **409.00** (this corresponds to the listed `probAmt: 409.0`, suggesting that portion may be handled/converted differently than a remaining “balance due”)

Collection percentage (based on amountDue vs paid):
- **352.00 / 761.00 ≈ 46.3% collected**

So, numerically:
- **Total assessed/due:** **$761.00**
- **Total paid:** **$352.00**
- **Remaining balance shown by WCCA:** **$0.00**
- **% collected (paid ÷ assessed):** **~46.3%**
