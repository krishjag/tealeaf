# Analysis of Manhattan's Highest-Value Properties

## 1. Zoning District Distribution

**Frequency of Primary Zoning Districts (zonedist1):**

| Zoning Type | Count | Properties |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **C5-2.5** | 6 | Blocks 1265, 1267, 1273, 1268, 1306, 1268 |
| **C6-4** | 6 | Blocks 58, 702, 706, 706, 783, 216 |
| **C6-6** | 3 | Blocks 1049, 995, 1308 |
| **C6-5.5** | 3 | Blocks 1001, 1002, 1000 |
| **C5-3** | 3 | Blocks 1294, 835, 1277 |
| **M1-5, M2-3** | 2 | Blocks 739, 680 (manufacturing) |
| **R7-2, R8** | 2 | Blocks 972, 1373, 2138 (residential) |
| **C6-7, C6-6.5, C5-2, PARK** | 1 each | Remaining properties |

**Key Findings:**
- **87% (26/30) are in Commercial (C) zones** - predominantly high-density commercial districts
- **C5 and C6 zones dominate**: These allow the highest commercial FAR (Floor Area Ratio) ranging from 10-15
- Only **2 properties in Manufacturing (M) zones**: 
  - Block 680: NY Convention Center (M2-3)
  - Block 739: 111 8th Avenue/Google Building (M1-5)
- Only **3 properties in Residential (R) zones**:
  - Block 972: Stuyvesant Town (R7-2, overlay C1-5)
  - Block 1373: Roosevelt Island (R7-2)
  - Block 2138: NY Presbyterian Hospital (R8)
- **1 property in PARK zone**: American Museum of Natural History

The C6 zones (especially C6-4, C6-5.5, C6-6) permit the most intensive commercial development with FARs of 10-15, explaining why they house Manhattan's most valuable properties.

## 6. Lot Coverage Ratio Analysis

**Methodology:** Coverage = (bldgfront × bldgdepth) ÷ lotarea × 100%

**Highest Lot Coverage (Most Intensive Use):**

| Rank | Block | Address | Coverage | Lot Area | Bldg Footprint | FAR |
|------|-------|---------|----------|----------|----------------|-----|
| 1 | **1266** | 1260 6th Ave | 34.4% | 184,764 | 63,240 | 14.80 |
| 2 | **1267** | 1290 6th Ave | 100.3%* | 89,775 | 90,048 | 21.16 |
| 3 | **835** | Empire State | 84.3% | 91,351 | 84,150 | 30.79 |
| 4 | **1273** | 9 W 57th St | 83.5% | 62,058 | 50,292 | 27.37 |
| 5 | **995** | One Bryant Park | 90.1% | 87,863 | 87,837 | 25.55 |
| 6 | **1294** | 761 5th Ave | 75.1% | 84,350 | 63,143 | 21.63 |

*Over 100% indicates building cantilevers or measurement discrepancy

**Lowest Lot Coverage (Campus/Horizontal Development):**

| Rank | Block | Address | Coverage | Lot Area | Use Type |
|------|-------|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1 | **1373** | Roosevelt Island | 0.0%* | 4.2M sf | Residential Campus |
| 2 | **972** | Stuyvesant Town | 1.0% | 2.7M sf | Residential Complex |
| 3 | **1130** | Natural History Museum | 16.3% | 738K sf | Museum Campus |
| 4 | **2138** | NY Presbyterian | Unknown | 364K sf | Hospital Campus |
| 5 | **680** | Convention Center | 49.5% | 962K sf | Exhibition Hall |

*Building dimensions listed as 0 for campus-style developments

**Key Findings:**

1. **Coverage correlates with building type:**
   - **Office towers (O4)**: 75-100% coverage - maximize lot usage
   - **Residential campuses**: <5% coverage - multiple low-rise buildings with green space
   - **Institutional**: 15-50% coverage - plaza and circulation space

2. **FAR vs Coverage:**
   - High FAR + High Coverage = Super-tall narrow towers (Empire State: 30.79 FAR, 84% coverage, 102 floors)
   - High FAR + Low Coverage = Campus development (Stuyvesant: 3.34 FAR, 1% coverage, 39 buildings)

3. **Midtown pattern**: Premium Midtown parcels show 80-100% coverage to maximize value of expensive land

4. **Data quality note**: Properties with bldgfront/bldgdepth = 0 are multi-building campuses where individual building footprints aren't measured

## Summary of Key Findings:

1. **Zoning**: 87% in commercial zones (C5/C6), enabling high-density development with FARs of 10-15

2. **Age**: 2000s buildings average highest value ($922M), but 1930s landmarks remain valuable; no simple age-value relationship
