## 1) Highest vs lowest average Job Openings rate (JO rate)

I averaged the **monthly JO rate** over 2025 for each industry in your extract.

### Highest average JO rate (top 3)
1. **Accommodation & food services (720000): ~5.93%**
2. **Leisure & hospitality (700000): ~5.74%**
3. **Health care & social assistance (620000): ~5.60%**  
   *(Very close: Professional & business services ~5.56%)*

### Lowest average JO rate (bottom 3)
1. **Construction (230000): ~2.90%**
2. **Government (900000): ~3.30%**
3. **Manufacturing (300000): ~3.19%**  
   *(Retail trade is higher at ~3.58%)*

**Interpretation (labor demand):**  
High JO rates in **hospitality/food** and **health care** indicate persistently strong labor demand relative to employment—often reflecting high turnover, hard-to-fill roles, and/or rapid replacement needs. Low JO rates in **construction/manufacturing/government** suggest comparatively less vacancy pressure (either weaker demand, better matching, slower replacement, or more stable staffing structures—government especially).

## 2) Labor market churn by industry (avg over 2025)
Definition you gave: **churn = (hires level + total separations level) / 2**, computed monthly then averaged over the year. Units are **thousands of workers**.

### Average churn (thousands), highest → lowest
1. **Total nonfarm (000000): ~5,267**
2. **Total private (100000): ~4,903**
3. **Professional & business services (540099): ~1,021**
4. **Leisure & hospitality (700000): ~956**
5. **Health care & social assistance (620000): ~707**
6. **Retail trade (440000): ~596**
7. **Government (900000): ~332**
8. **Accommodation & food services (720000): ~791** *(note: this is a sub-sector of leisure & hospitality; it sits between retail and health care if ranked among all shown—see note below)*
9. **Manufacturing (300000): ~314**
10. **Construction (230000): ~342**
11. **Financial activities (510099): ~201**
12. **Information (510000): ~87**

**Note on hierarchy:** You have overlapping aggregates (e.g., Total nonfarm includes Total private + Government; Leisure & hospitality includes Accommodation & food). The churn ranking above is still mechanically correct for each series, but comparisons across overlapping aggregates should be interpreted carefully.

**What churn captures:** sectors like **PBS** and **Leisure & hospitality** move very large numbers of workers in and out each month (high “worker flow” intensity), while **Information** and **Financial activities** show much lower flow volumes.

## 3) Net hiring rate (avg HI rate − avg TS rate)

I averaged monthly **hire rates** and **total separation rates** and took the difference.

### Net hiring rate by industry (percentage points), 2025 avg
- **Total nonfarm:** ~**+0.10 pp** (3.37 − 3.27)
- **Total private:** ~**+0.11 pp** (3.67 − 3.56)
- **Construction:** ~**+0.08 pp** (4.17 − 4.09)
- **Manufacturing:** ~**−0.03 pp** (2.42 − 2.45)
- **Retail trade:** ~**−0.03 pp** (3.78 − 3.81)
- **Information:** ~**−0.02 pp** (2.94 − 2.96)
- **Financial activities:** ~**+0.17 pp** (2.33 − 2.16)
- **Professional & business services:** ~**−0.05 pp** (4.57 − 4.62)
- **Health care & social assistance:** ~**+0.30 pp** (3.11 − 2.81)
- **Leisure & hospitality:** ~**+0.02 pp** (5.72 − 5.70)
- **Accommodation & food services:** ~**+0.02 pp** (5.62 − 5.60)
- **Government:** ~**+0.08 pp** (1.45 − 1.37)

### Growing (positive net) vs shrinking (negative net)
**Growing (positive):** Health care & social assistance (strongest), Financial activities, Total private, Total nonfarm, Construction, Government, Leisure & hospitality, Accommodation & food.  
**Shrinking (negative):** Professional & business services, Manufacturing, Retail trade, Information.

## 4) Leisure & hospitality vs Professional & business services (avg rates, all 6 metrics)

Averages of monthly **rates** in 2025:

### Leisure & hospitality (700000) — avg rates
- **JO:** ~**5.74%**
- **HI:** ~**5.72%**
- **TS:** ~**5.70%**
- **QU:** ~**4.02%**
- **LD:** ~**1.40%**
- **OS:** ~**0.12%**

### Professional & business services (540099) — avg rates
- **JO:** ~**5.56%**
- **HI:** ~**4.57%**
- **TS:** ~**4.62%**
- **QU:** ~**2.38%**
- **LD:** ~**2.00%**
- **OS:** ~**0.23%**

### Structural differences in workforce dynamics
- **Turnover model differs:** Leisure & hospitality has **very high quits** (QU ~4.0%) and very high hires/separations overall (~5.7%), consistent with a **high-churn, quit-driven** labor market (shorter job tenures, frequent job switching).
- **PBS separations are more employer-driven than L&H:** PBS has **much higher layoff/discharge rate** (LD ~2.0%) than L&H (~1.4%), and quits are far lower. That mix suggests **more cyclical/organizational adjustment** (project-based staffing, contracting, business cycle sensitivity).
- **Other separations:** PBS OS (~0.23%) is about double L&H (~0.12%), consistent with a somewhat older/more career-tenured workforce and more non-quit exits (retirements/transfers).

## 5) Construction seasonality (hires level): max, min, range

Construction **hires level (thousands)** by month:
- Max: **April = 364**
- Min: **March = 306**
- **Range:** 364 − 306 = **58 (thousand)**

---

## 6) Separation composition: quits vs layoffs vs other (levels)

For each industry, I summed 2025 levels of **QU, LD, OS**, and computed shares of **total separations** (TS). (Because TS ≈ QU+LD+OS each month, shares are stable.)

### Shares of total separations (2025)
- **Total nonfarm:** QU **~61.4%**, LD **~32.0%**, OS **~6.6%**
- **Total private:** QU **~61.5%**, LD **~32.8%**, OS **~5.7%**
- **Construction:** QU **~45.5%**, LD **~49.4%**, OS **~5.1%**
- **Manufacturing:** QU **~57.0%**, LD **~36.4%**, OS **~6.6%**
- **Retail trade:** QU **~69.0%**, LD **~28.4%**, OS **~2.6%**
- **Information:** QU **~44.4%**, LD **~46.8%**, OS **~8.8%**
- **Financial activities:** QU **~62.0%**, LD **~26.9%**, OS **~11.1%**
- **Professional & business services:** QU **~52.2%**, LD **~43.0%**, OS **~4.8%**
- **Health care & social assistance:** QU **~71.0%**, LD **~23.6%**, OS **~5.4%**
- **Leisure & hospitality:** QU **~73.5%**, LD **~24.0%**, OS **~2.5%**
- **Accommodation & food services:** QU **~78.7%**, LD **~19.3%**, OS **~2.0%**
- **Government:** QU **~56.8%**, LD **~25.4%**, OS **~17.8%**

### Highest quit share / highest layoff share
- **Highest quit share:** **Accommodation & food services (~78.7%)**
- **Highest layoff share:** **Construction (~49.4%)**  
  *(Information is also very layoff-heavy at ~46.8%.)*

## 7) “Ratio of unemployed persons implied by job openings” for Total nonfarm

To compute a **job openings–to–unemployed** tightness ratio (or its inverse), we need **the number of unemployed persons (level)**—typically from CPS (BLS unemployment level), not provided in your JOLTS extract.

What I *can* compute from your data:
- **Average Total nonfarm job openings level (2025):**  
  (sum of monthly JO levels 7,762…6,542) / 12 ≈ **7,326 thousand**.

To finish the ratio you described:
- If unemployed level is **U (thousand)**, then:
  - **Openings per unemployed = JO / U**
  - **Unemployed per opening = U / JO**

If you provide either:
- monthly (or annual avg) **unemployment level**, or
- unemployment rate **and** employment/labor force level to convert to unemployed persons,

…I can compute the ratio precisely and show how it changes by month (tightness seasonality).

If you want, tell me whether you prefer **openings per unemployed** (common “tightness” metric) or **unemployed per opening** (your phrasing), and whether to use **annual average** or **December**.
