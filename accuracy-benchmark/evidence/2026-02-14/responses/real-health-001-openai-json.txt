## 4) King (most urban) vs Ferry (most rural): smoking, obesity, depression, insurance access

(Values are crude prevalence %, with 95% CI)

| Measure | King | Ferry | Difference (Ferry − King) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Current smoking (CSMOKING) | 7.2 (5.8–8.9) | 16.0 (13.5–19.0) | **+8.8** |
| Obesity (OBESITY) | 22.6 (20.4–24.9) | 40.2 (33.4–47.9) | **+17.6** |
| Depression (DEPRESSION) | 23.5 (21.7–25.3) | 25.0 (21.7–28.8) | **+1.5** |
| Lack of insurance 18–64 (ACCESS2) | 6.8 (5.5–8.4) | 8.5 (6.9–10.4) | **+1.7** |

Key pattern: Ferry is substantially higher on **smoking** and **obesity**, modestly higher on **uninsurance**, and only slightly higher on **depression**.

## 5) Health risk behavior (RISKBEH) with the **widest disparity** (max − min)

Computed across the counties shown:

- **Physical inactivity (LPA)**: max **27.9** (Yakima) − min **13.9** (King) = **14.0 points**  ← **widest**
- Short sleep duration (SLEEP): max **37.0** (Pierce) − min **29.0** (King/Island) = **8.0**
- Current smoking (CSMOKING): max **16.0** (Ferry) − min **7.2** (King) = **8.8**
- Binge drinking (BINGE): max **17.9** (Whatcom) − min **14.0** (Ferry) = **3.9**

**Answer:** **LPA (physical inactivity)** shows the widest county disparity.

## 6) Counties where **>3 health outcomes** exceed the 10-county average by **5+ points**

Method: for each HLTHOUT measure, compute the **10-county mean** (using the 10 counties provided), then flag county-measure pairs where county value ≥ (mean + 5). Identify counties with **more than 3** such flagged HLTHOUT measures.

### Result: **Only Ferry County** meets the criterion (>3 measures)

Ferry exceeds the 10-county average by **≥5 points** on **6** HLTHOUT measures:

- **Arthritis:** 38.0 vs avg ~26.4 (**+11.6**)  
- **High blood pressure:** 41.1 vs avg ~32.5 (**+8.6**)  
- **CHD:** 10.0 vs avg ~6.3 (**+3.7**) *(not ≥5; included here only if listing—see below)*  
- **COPD:** 9.8 vs avg ~6.0 (**+3.8**) *(not ≥5)*  
- **Diabetes:** 15.1 vs avg ~10.7 (**+4.4**) *(not ≥5)*  
- **High cholesterol:** 41.2 vs avg ~35.8 (**+5.4**) ✅  
- **Obesity:** 40.2 vs avg ~33.4 (**+6.8**) ✅  
- **Stroke:** 5.2 vs avg ~3.4 (**+1.8**) *(not ≥5)*  
- **Cancer:** 11.4 vs avg ~8.8 (**+2.6**) *(not ≥5)*  
- **Asthma:** 12.3 vs avg ~11.0 (**+1.3**) *(not ≥5)*  
- **Teeth lost (65+):** 13.7 vs avg ~10.7 (**+3.0**) *(not ≥5)*  

To be precise about the **≥5** threshold, Ferry clearly qualifies on at least:
- **Arthritis (+11.6)**
- **High blood pressure (+8.6)**
- **High cholesterol (+5.4)**
- **Obesity (+6.8)**

That is **4 HLTHOUT measures ≥5 points above average**, so Ferry is the only county with **more than 3** such exceedances.

All other counties have **≤3** HLTHOUT measures that are ≥5 points above the 10-county mean.
