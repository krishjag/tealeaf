Below is an analytic read of the **properties shown in your excerpt** (I can see **~25 records** in the JSON you pasted, not all 30). Results therefore reflect the visible records only.

## 1) Zoning district distribution (zonedist1) + what it permits (C vs M vs R)

### Frequency (zonedist1) among the visible high-value lots
Most common districts in this slice:

- **C6-4** (very frequent): e.g., 185 Greenwich St; 500 W 33; 427 10 Ave; 527 W 34; 388 Greenwich; 250 W 34 (also appears as zonedist2 on some)
- **C5-2.5 / C5-3** (very frequent): many Midtown core office towers (Park Ave / 6th Ave / 5th Ave / 42nd St / 57th St)
- **C6-6 / C6-5.5 / C6-6.5 / C6-7** (several): Midtown high-density commercial districts
- A few non-commercial districts:
  - **M2-3** (1): 360 West St (Javits Center)
  - **M1-5** (1): 111 8 Ave
  - **R7-2** (2): 240 1 Ave; Roosevelt Island “Main Street”
  - **R8** (1): 180 Ft Washington Ave (hospital/institutional)
  - **PARK** (1): 200 Central Park West (museum)

### What the zoning implies (high-level)
- **C5- / C6- districts (Commercial)**: permit **high-density office/commercial** and typically allow significant FAR; in Midtown core (C5-2.5, C5-3) you see classic trophy office towers and major mixed commercial.
- **M1- / M2- districts (Manufacturing)**: allow manufacturing/warehouse and many commercial uses depending on district; **M2-3** is heavier manufacturing than M1. In practice, Manhattan M-zoned “high value” lots often host large special-purpose facilities or converted commercial space.
- **R7-2 / R8 (Residential)**: primarily residential bulk controls (often with overlays like C1-5) and institutional/community facility allowances; in your sample these correspond to **large residential campuses** or **medical/institutional** uses.
- **PARK**: parkland/open space zoning; here it’s a major cultural facility.

### Properties in M vs C vs R (by zonedist1)
- **Manufacturing (M)**  
  - **M2-3**: 360 WEST STREET (P9, convention center)  
  - **M1-5**: 111 8 AVENUE (O6, large office in M-zone)

- **Commercial (C)** (dominant)  
  Examples: 185 Greenwich (C6-4), 761 5 Ave (C5-3), 1111 6 Ave (C6-6), 1250 6 Ave (C5-2.5), 51 E 42 (C5-3), 345 Park (C5-2.5), 601 Lex (C6-6), 9 W 57 (C5-2.5), etc.

- **Residential (R)**  
  - **R7-2**: 240 1 AVENUE (D7, huge residential); MAIN STREET (D4, large residential/mixed)  
  - **R8**: 180 FT WASHINGTON AVENUE (I1, hospital/institution)

- **Other**  
  - **PARK**: 200 CENTRAL PARK WEST (P7, museum)

**Takeaway:** the “highest assessed value” set is overwhelmingly **Midtown/L.Manhattan high-density commercial zoning (C5/C6)**, with a small number of **very large campus-like residential/institutional** properties and a couple of **M-zoned** outliers.

## 2) Building age profile by decade + average assessed value per decade + relationship to value

### Decade grouping (visible records)
(Using `yearbuilt`; counts approximate to the visible set)

- **1930s**: 111 8 Ave (1931), Empire State Building (1931), 1260 6 Ave (1932), 1250 6 Ave (1937) … plus hospital record is 1930  
- **1940s**: 240 1 Ave (1945)
- **1950s**: 666 5 Ave (1958)
- **1960s**: 360 West (1963), 1290 6 Ave (1963), 1271 6 Ave (1961), 761 5 Ave (1968), 345 Park (1969)
- **1970s**: many (1221 6 Ave 1971; 1631 Broadway 1972; 250 W 34 1972; 1211 6 Ave 1973; Roosevelt Island 1975; 601 Lex 1978; etc.)
- **1980s**: 388 Greenwich (1989)
- **1990s**: 200 Central Park West (1998)
- **2000s**: 1 Columbus Circle (2004), One Bryant Park (2005), 185 Greenwich (2009), One Beacon Court (2001)
- **2010s**: 500 W 33 (2015), One Vanderbilt (2017), 527 W 34 (2018), 427 10 Ave (2019)

### Average assessed value per decade (computed from visible records)
Using `assesstot`:

- **1930s (n=4)**: avg ≈ **$581.9M**  
  (ESB 534.0; 111 8 Ave 531.1; 1260 6 Ave 498.6; 1250 6 Ave 619.0)
- **1940s (n=1)**: avg ≈ **$791.8M**
- **1950s (n=1)**: avg ≈ **$449.8M**
- **1960s (n=6)**: avg ≈ **$651.2M**
- **1970s (n=6)**: avg ≈ **$481.3M**
- **1980s (n=1)**: avg ≈ **$520.0M**
- **1990s (n=1)**: avg ≈ **$474.4M**
- **2000s (n=4)**: avg ≈ **$940.4M**  
  (Time Warner Center 794.4; One Bryant Park 787.0; One Beacon Court 506.6; 185 Greenwich 1,673.5)
- **2010s (n=4)**: avg ≈ **$626.5M**  
  (500 W 33 743.7; One Vanderbilt 523.7; 527 W 34 541.5; 427 10 Ave 699.3)
- **1930 (n=1)**: avg ≈ **$460.3M** (hospital)

### Relationship: newer = higher?
Not monotonic.

- The **2000s decade is highest on average** in this slice, but it’s heavily influenced by **185 Greenwich (WTC site)** at **$1.67B**.
- The **2010s are high**, but not higher than the 2000s here.
- Many **1930s/1960s Midtown trophy offices** still have **very high assessments**, reflecting location, scale, and office rents more than age.

**Takeaway:** assessed value correlates more with **location (Midtown core / WTC), scale, and use (office trophy)** than simply “newness,” though new supertalls do show up near the top.

## 3) Area composition (% of bldgarea) + most mixed-use vs single-purpose

For each property, you can compute:
- %Commercial = `comarea / bldgarea`
- %Residential = `resarea / bldgarea`
- %Office = `officearea / bldgarea`
- %Retail = `retailarea / bldgarea`
- %Other = `otherarea / bldgarea`

### Examples (illustrative from visible records)
- **185 Greenwich (WTC)**: comarea = bldgarea (≈100% commercial); office ~80%, retail ~9%, other ~11 → **commercial but internally mixed (office/retail/other)**.
- **1 Columbus Circle (Time Warner Center condo)**: comarea ~69%, res ~21%, office ~37%, retail ~20% (note office+retail are subsets of commercial reporting fields) → **strong mixed-use**.
- **240 1 Avenue (StuyTown/Peter Cooper-like campus)**: resarea ~94%, comarea ~6% → **mostly residential** with some commercial.
- **427 10 Avenue (new Hudson Yards-area office)**: office ~99%, retail small → **mostly single-purpose office**.
- **Empire State Building**: office dominant with some retail → **primarily office**.

### “Most mixed-use” (multiple area types > 0)
By inspection of the visible records, the clearest mixed-use lots are those with **both resarea > 0 and meaningful commercial sub-areas**:
- **1 Columbus Circle (RM)**: res + office + retail + other + garage
- **151 E 58 St (One Beacon Court, RM)**: res + office + retail
- **240 1 Avenue (D7)**: res + retail + office + garage
- **MAIN STREET (Roosevelt Island, D4)**: res + retail + office + garage + other

### “Single-purpose” (dominant one use)
- Many **O4 office towers**: comarea=bldgarea and officearea ≈ bldgarea (retail often 0 or small)
- **Institutional/special-purpose**:  
  - 200 Central Park West (museum): “otherarea” dominates  
  - 180 Ft Washington (hospital): “otherarea” dominates  
  - 360 West (convention center): storage/other dominate

**Note on PLUTO fields:** `officearea` and `retailarea` are typically components of `comarea`, so summing office+retail+com can exceed bldgarea if treated incorrectly. Best practice: treat **comarea vs resarea vs otherarea** as top-level, and use office/retail as **breakdowns within commercial**.

---

## 4) numfloors vs bldgarea + average floor plate (bldgarea/numfloors) + patterns by class

### Metric
- **Average floor plate size** ≈ `bldgarea / numfloors` (gross, not true typical floorplate, but useful)

### Largest floor plates (visible records)
Biggest “floor plate” values are the **low-rise megastructures / campuses**, not the tall towers:

- **360 WEST STREET (P9, convention center)**: 4,060,596 / 4 ≈ **1,015,149 sf/floor**
- **240 1 AVENUE (D7, residential campus)**: 8,942,176 / 13 ≈ **687,860 sf/floor**
- **180 FT WASHINGTON (I1, hospital)**: 3,693,539 / 22 ≈ **167,888 sf/floor**
- **200 CENTRAL PARK WEST (P7, museum)**: 1,360,264 / 7 ≈ **194,323 sf/floor**
- **111 8 AVENUE (O6)**: 2,161,994 / 17 ≈ **127,176 sf/floor**

Typical Midtown office towers (O4/RC) are much smaller per floor:
- **Empire State (O4)**: 2,812,739 / 102 ≈ **27,576 sf/floor**
- **One Vanderbilt (O4)**: 1,678,135 / 60 ≈ **27,969 sf/floor**
- **427 10 Ave (O4)**: 2,521,850 / 58 ≈ **43,480 sf/floor**

### Pattern by building class
- **P9 / P7 / D7 / I1** (special-purpose, institutional, campus): **very large floor plates**
- **O4 / RC** (office towers / commercial condos): **smaller floor plates**, higher floor counts

## 5) Top 5 owners by total assessed value + concentration

From the visible records, owners that appear and their assessed totals:

1) **LOWER MANHATTAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION** (185 Greenwich) ≈ **$1.673B**
2) **NEW YORK CONVENTION CENTER** (360 West) ≈ **$0.931B**
3) **TIME WARNER CENTER CONDOMINIUM** ≈ **$0.794B**
4) **BPP ST OWNER LLC** (240 1 Ave) ≈ **$0.792B**
5) **767 FIFTH PARTNERS LLC** (761 5 Ave) ≈ **$0.791B**

### Do owners repeat?
Yes—some major owners/labels repeat in the visible slice:
- **ROCKEFELLER-related** appears multiple times (e.g., “ROCKEFELLER CENTER PROPERTIES (RCP)” and “ROCKEFELLER CTR NORTH INC”) but as **different ownername strings**, so you’d want to normalize to a parent entity to measure true concentration.
- Several records have **“UNAVAILABLE OWNER”** (multiple occurrences). If you aggregate that literal string, it will look artificially concentrated.

### Concentration (rough)
The top property (WTC) is an outlier at **$1.67B**. After that, the next tier clusters around **$0.45B–$0.93B**. Ownership concentration is **moderate in this slice** unless you normalize affiliates (Rockefeller, etc.) and resolve “UNAVAILABLE OWNER.”

## 6) Lot vs building dimensions + implied lot coverage ratio

### Metric (implied)
- **Implied footprint** = `bldgfront * bldgdepth` (very approximate; PLUTO fronts/depths can be irregular/0)
- **Lot coverage ratio** ≈ `(bldgfront*bldgdepth) / lotarea`

### Data quality caveats
Several records have **bldgfront=0 and/or bldgdepth=0** (e.g., 527 W 34; Roosevelt Island; 151 E 58), which makes the implied footprint unusable. Also, many lots are irregular (`irrlotcode=true`), so rectangle approximation is crude.

### Highest coverage (among those with nonzero dims)
Examples:
- **111 8 AVENUE**: 207*800=165,600; lotarea 165,200 → **~1.00** (near full coverage)
- **360 WEST STREET**: 1227.5*389≈477,498; lotarea 962,250 → **~0.50**
- **250 WEST 34 STREET**: 647*197≈127,459; lotarea 127,966 → **~1.00**
- **338 5 AVENUE (ESB lot)**: 198*425=84,150; lotarea 91,351 → **~0.92**
- **1290 6 AVE**: 201*448=90,048; lotarea 89,775 → **~1.00** (slightly >1 due to rounding/inconsistency)

### Lowest coverage (among those with nonzero dims)
- **185 GREENWICH (WTC)**: 200*198=39,600; lotarea 833,945 → **~0.05**  
  (reflects multi-building site, plazas/open areas, and the “front/depth” not representing the whole complex)

**Takeaway:** Midtown commercial lots often show **very high coverage** (near full-lot footprints), while large campus/special sites show **low coverage**.

## 7) Geographic clustering (lat/long): Midtown vs Lower Manhattan vs other + relationship to type/value

### Quick clustering by latitude (rule-of-thumb)
- **Lower Manhattan (~40.70–40.72)**  
  - 185 Greenwich (40.7116) — **highest value** in slice  
  - 388 Greenwich (40.7209)

- **Midtown core (~40.75–40.76)** (dominant cluster)  
  Many: 1111 6 Ave (40.7556), 1250 6 Ave (40.7591), 1221 6 Ave (40.7594), 1211 6 Ave (40.7587), 345 Park (40.7578), 601 Lex (40.7584), 51 E 42 (40.7530), etc.

- **Upper West Side / Museum Mile-ish (~40.78)**  
  - 200 Central Park West (40.7814)

- **Upper Manhattan (~40.84)**  
  - 180 Ft Washington (40.8407) hospital/institution

- **East Side / Roosevelt Island (~40.766)**  
  - MAIN STREET (40.7662) large residential campus  
  - 1 Columbus Circle is ~40.7685 (Columbus Circle, edge of Midtown/UWS)

### Relationship between location and property type/value
- **Midtown cluster**: overwhelmingly **C5/C6 office towers** (O4/RC) with high FAR and high assessments driven by office rents and centrality.
- **Lower Manhattan**: fewer properties in this slice, but includes an extreme outlier (WTC) with very high assessed value and massive office area.
- **Outside core (UWS / Upper Manhattan / Roosevelt Island)**: high assessed values are associated with **institutional or large residential campuses** rather than office towers.
