# Comprehensive Criminal Justice Analysis: State v. Ramirez

## 1. CHARGE PROGRESSION ANALYSIS

### Original vs. Final Charges
**Both charges remained intact from Information to verdict:**

**Charge 1: Battery by Prisoners - Wis. Stat. § 940.20(1) (Felony H)**
- **Modifiers Applied:**
  - **Repeater Enhancement:** § 939.62(1)(b) - Increases penalties for prior felony convictions
  - **Use of a Dangerous Weapon:** § 939.63(1)(b) - Sentence enhancer increasing maximum terms
- **Verdict:** Found Guilty at Jury Trial (with weapon enhancer)

**Charge 2: Disorderly Conduct - Wis. Stat. § 947.01(1) (Misd. B)**
- **Modifiers Applied:**
  - **Repeater Enhancement:** § 939.62(1)(a) - Misdemeanor repeater provision
- **Disposition Note:** "With use of a dangerous weapon enhancer dismissed"
- **Verdict:** Found Guilty at Jury Trial (without weapon enhancer)

### Key Finding
No charges were added or dropped. The critical development was the application of **repeater enhancements to both charges** (indicating prior criminal history) and a **dangerous weapon enhancer to Charge 1**. The weapon enhancer was initially charged but ultimately dismissed on Charge 2, suggesting prosecutorial negotiation or evidentiary issues specific to that count.

## 4. SENTENCING STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

### Charge 1: Battery by Prisoners (Class H Felony with Repeater & Weapon Enhancers)

**Initial Confinement:** 12 years  
**Relationship:** CONSECUTIVE to any other sentence currently serving

**Extended Supervision:** 3 years  
**Relationship:** CONSECUTIVE to any other sentence currently serving

**Specific Conditions:**
1. **DNA Submission:** Required (standard for felonies)
2. **No Contact Order:** Prohibited contact with the victim
3. **Costs:** $518.00
4. **Financial Judgment:** "If probation is revoked or will discharge with outstanding financial obligations due, a civil judgment shall be entered for the balance due"

### Charge 2: Disorderly Conduct (Class B Misdemeanor with Repeater)

**Initial Confinement:** 1 year  
**Relationship:** CONCURRENT with Count 1

**Extended Supervision:** 6 months  
**Relationship:** CONCURRENT with Count 1

**Specific Conditions:**
1. **Costs:** $243.00
2. **Incorporation:** "Same conditions as Ct. 1" (includes DNA, no-contact, financial terms)

### Critical Sentencing Distinctions

**Consecutive vs. Concurrent Structure:**
- The consecutive nature of Charge 1 is **aggravating** - adds 15 years *on top of* whatever sentence defendant was serving when the offense occurred
- Charge 2 runs concurrent, adding no additional time
- This structure reflects the seriousness of battery by a prisoner (institutional violence while incarcerated)

**Practical Impact:**
- **Total Additional Time:** 15 years (12 IC + 3 ES) consecutive
- **No Jail Credit:** Court specifically noted "No jail credit" at sentencing
- **Ineligibility:** "Defendant is not eligible for the challenge incarceration program or substance abuse program"
- **Current Location:** Wisconsin Secure Program Facility (maximum security) as of November 29, 2022

**Weapon Enhancement Impact:**
- The dangerous weapon enhancer on Charge 1 likely elevated the sentence significantly
- Court record indicates weapon was a **"#1 Pencil in brown bag"** (Exhibit from trial)
- Standard Class H felony maximum: 6 years; with enhancers: substantially increased

## 5. HABEAS CORPUS ACTIVITY ANALYSIS

### Comprehensive Writ Count: **20+ Writs of Habeas Corpus**

**Chronological Pattern:**

**Pre-Trial Phase (2016):** 9 writs
- February 2016: 3 writs (multiple hearing dates)
- March 2016: 1 writ
- June 2016: 1 writ
- July-August 2016: 4 writs

**Pre-Trial Phase (2018-2019):** 5 writs
- February 2018: 2 writs (trial preparation)
- December 2019: 3 writs (for jury trial and sentencing)

**Post-Conviction Phase (2021):** 6 writs
- August 2021: 4 petitions/writs (for evidentiary hearing)
- October-November 2021: 2 writs (for continued hearings)

### Institutional Movement Pattern
**Defendant's Prison Transfers:**
1. **Waupun Correctional Institution** (2016 - initial)
2. **Green Bay Correctional Institution** (July 2016 - November 2022)
3. **Wisconsin Secure Program Facility (Boscobel)** (November 2022 - present)

### Analysis of Habeas Pattern

**What This Suggests:**

1. **Incarcerated Status Throughout:** Defendant was already serving a sentence when the 2015 offense occurred and remained incarcerated throughout this entire case (2016-2025)

2. **Administrative Burden:** Each court appearance required:
   - Petition for writ filed by DA's office
   - Proposed order submitted to court
   - Order signed by Judge Voigt
   - Coordination with DOC for transport or video appearance
   - Security arrangements

3. **Shift to Video Technology:** Later entries (2019-2023) show increased use of "video conferencing" and "appeared by video Zoom," reducing need for physical transport

4. **Systemic Implications:** The volume of habeas activity reflects the logistical complexity of prosecuting incarcerated defendants, requiring coordination between multiple correctional facilities and the court system

5. **Constitutional Necessity:** Each writ ensures defendant's Sixth Amendment right to be present at critical proceedings, despite incarceration

## 6. MOTION PRACTICE ANALYSIS

### Motion Categorization by Type & Frequency

#### **Category 1: Time Extension Motions (MOST FREQUENT)**
**Count: 10+ motions**

**Post-Conviction Phase:**
- June 2020: Motion to extend time for appointing counsel
- October 2020: Motion to extend time for filing postconviction motion
- December 2020: Second motion to extend time
- February 2021: Third motion to extend time
- April 2021: Fourth motion to extend time
- December 2021: Motion to extend time for circuit court ruling (multiple)
- March 2022: Fourth motion to extend circuit court ruling deadline
- January 2023: Motion to extend time for supplemental motion ruling

**Analysis:** Extension motions dominated the post-conviction phase, reflecting:
- Complexity of speedy trial analysis requiring extensive research
- Court reporter delays in producing transcripts
- Appellate counsel workload (State Public Defender office)
- Court of Appeals willingness to grant reasonable extensions

#### **Category 2: Discovery Motions**
**Count: 4 motions**

- March 15, 2016: Defense demand for discovery + petition for leave to file additional motions
- March 28, 2016: State's motion and demand for discovery with DNA/witness list
- Multiple discovery letters between counsel (2016-2019)

**Phase:** Pre-trial (2016)

#### **Category 3: Trial-Related Motions**
**Count: 4 motions**

- March 26, 2019: Notice of Motions in Limine (multiple by Atty. Benavides)
- March 26, 2019: Additional Motions in Limine to Exclude Statements
- April 15, 2019: **Motion to Dismiss** (denied June 17, 2019)
- March 6, 2018: Motion for Continuance (granted)

**Phase:** Pre-trial (2018-2019), clustering before scheduled trials

#### **Category 4: Substantive Post-Conviction Motions**
**Count: 3 major motions**

- June 21, 2021: **Defendant's Postconviction Motion to Vacate Conviction and Dismiss Case for Speedy Trial Violation**
  - Evidentiary hearing: November 29, 2021
  - Denied: May 13, 2022

- October 28, 2022: **Defendant's Supplemental Postconviction Motion/Motion to Reconsider** (filed after Court of Appeals remand)
  - Denied: May 16, 2023

- February 14, 2022: Defendant's Further Brief in Support of Postconviction Motion

**Phase:** Post-conviction (2021-2023)

### Motion Activity by Case Phase

#### **Highest Motion Activity: Post-Conviction Phase (2020-2023)**

**Statistical Breakdown:**
- **Pre-Trial Phase (2016-2019):** ~8-10 motions over 3.5 years
- **Post-Conviction Phase (2020-2023):** ~15+ motions over 3 years
- **Peak Period:** 2021-2022 (evidentiary hearing and initial appeal)

#### **Motion Success Rate Analysis**

**Defense Motion Outcomes:**
- **Continuance Motions:** Granted (multiple occasions)
- **Extension Motions:** Granted (all 10+ requests)
- **Motion to Dismiss (2019):** **DENIED** by circuit court
- **Postconviction Motion (2021):** **DENIED** by circuit court
- **Supplemental Motion (2022):** **DENIED** by circuit court
- **Appeal:** **GRANTED** by Court of Appeals (reversal)

**State Motion Outcomes:**
- Discovery motions: Granted
- Trial continuances: Granted
- Habeas corpus petitions: Granted (routine)

### Pattern Analysis

**Key Findings:**

1. **Extension Motions as Procedural Necessity:** The volume of extension motions reflects the complexity of post-conviction litigation and court system delays, not dilatory tactics

2. **Strategic Pre-Trial Motion Practice:** Defense filed motions in limine and motion to dismiss shortly before the December 2019 trial, suggesting late case development

3. **Persistent Post-Conviction Advocacy:** Despite two circuit court denials, defense counsel successfully preserved speedy trial issue through supplemental motion practice

4. **Court of Appeals Intervention:** The remand for supplemental motion (September 2022) was critical - it allowed development of additional speedy trial record

5. **Transcript Delays:** Multiple motion extensions were necessitated by court reporter delays in producing transcripts (noted in July 2022 Court of Appeals letter directing reporter to file "forthwith")

## ANALYTICAL CONCLUSIONS

This case exemplifies the **constitutional tension between efficient prosecution and speedy trial rights**. The 38-month delay between arraignment (October 2016) and trial (December 2019), despite a September 2018 speedy trial demand, ultimately proved fatal to the conviction. While the circuit court twice rejected the speedy trial claim, the Court of Appeals found the delay violated constitutional protections, ordering dismissal rather than retrial—a remedy suggesting prejudice to the defendant or prosecutorial responsibility for delay.

The extensive post-conviction litigation (5+ years) demonstrates the **multi-tiered safeguards in Wisconsin's appellate system**, including the Court of Appeals' innovative use of remand procedures to develop the record. The Supreme Court's decision to grant review but apparently affirm the reversal validates the speedy trial analysis.

Finally, the **20+ habeas corpus writs** underscore the logistical complexities of prosecuting incarcerated defendants, requiring coordination between multiple maximum-security facilities and the court system over a decade-long period. The case ultimately vindicates the defendant's constitutional rights despite the serious nature of the charges and the jury's guilty verdict.
