## 8) Flags: concerning debt levels or negative free cash flow
- **Negative FCF:** None (all four are positive based on provided CFO and capex).
- **Concerning leverage (relative within this set):**
  - **Apple**: **Debt/Equity 1.34x** (meaningfully more levered than peers here). Not necessarily distressed given very large CFO/FCF, but it is the clear leverage outlier.
- **Interest coverage concerns:**
  - Visa (40.7x), Costco (67.4x), Qualcomm (18.6x) all show strong coverage.
  - **Apple**: interest expense not present in the provided Income Statement lines, so **coverage cannot be computed from the supplied dataset excerpt** (would need the interest expense tag from Apple’s income statement/cash flow supplemental disclosures).

If you want, I can also compute a **net debt** view (debt minus cash & marketable securities) to compare “balance sheet strength” for cash-rich companies like Apple.
