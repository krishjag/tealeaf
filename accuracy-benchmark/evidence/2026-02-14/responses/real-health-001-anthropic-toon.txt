## Key Findings Summary

1. **Rural Health Crisis:** Ferry County shows the most severe health challenges across nearly all measured outcomes, with 4 conditions exceeding state averages by 5+ percentage points

2. **Urban Advantage:** King County consistently shows the lowest rates for negative health outcomes (obesity, diabetes, smoking, physical inactivity)

3. **Metabolic Syndrome Prevalence:** High cholesterol, high blood pressure, and obesity appear as the top 3 conditions in most counties, indicating widespread cardiovascular disease risk

4. **Mental Health Parity:** Depression rates are relatively consistent across urban and rural areas (22.6-29.5%), suggesting mental health challenges transcend geographic boundaries

5. **Preventive Care Gap:** Physical inactivity shows the largest geographic disparity (14 percentage points), suggesting differential access to recreational facilities or lifestyle differences between urban and rural communities

6. **Health Equity Concerns:** The rural-urban divide is particularly pronounced for modifiable risk factors (smoking, obesity, physical inactivity), suggesting opportunities for targeted public health interventions
