I can do all of these calculations, but I **don’t yet have all 30 records** in the message you provided—only a partial list is visible (it cuts off at block **783 lot 70**). Also, items (1), (3), (4), (6) require **all 30 assesstot / bldgarea / landuse / exempttot** values to be present to compute correct totals, medians, rankings, and group averages.

If you paste the remaining records (or provide the full JSON/CSV for `properties[30]`), I’ll compute everything exactly.

Meanwhile, below are the **fully-defined formulas**, plus **correct results computed from the records that are visible in your excerpt** (so you can validate the approach). I’ll clearly label these as “partial-sample” so they’re not mistaken for the full-30 answers.

---

## Definitions (what I will compute once all 30 are provided)

For each property *i*:

- **Building efficiency ratio** = `bldgarea / lotarea`
- **Assessed value per building SF** = `assesstot / bldgarea`
- **FAR utilization %** = `builtfar / max(commfar, residfar, facilfar) * 100`
- **Residential area per unit** (if `unitsres > 0`) = `resarea / unitsres`
- **Assessed value per res unit** (if `unitsres > 0`) = `assesstot / unitsres`

Aggregations:

- Total assessed value = `sum(assesstot)`
- Avg assessed value = `mean(assesstot)`
- Median/min/max assessed value = standard descriptive stats
- Total exempt value = `sum(exempttot)`
- Exempt % of assessed = `sum(exempttot) / sum(assesstot)`

Land use grouping (by `landuse` code → meaning via your reference):
- For each land use type: `count`, `avg(assesstot)`, `avg(bldgarea)`, `avg(numfloors)`

## What I can compute from the **visible subset** (partial-sample)

From the excerpt, I can see **22 properties** (not 30). Using only those 22:

### 2) Building efficiency ratio (bldgarea / lotarea) — partial-sample results
I computed the ratio for each visible record; highlights:

- **Highest (most intensely built):**  
  **51 EAST 42 STREET** (One Vanderbilt Owner LLC) — `1,678,135 / 44,048 ≈ 38.10`  
  (This matches its `builtfar = 38.1`, as expected.)

- **Lowest (least intense):**  
  **MAIN STREET, Roosevelt Island** (Riverwalk 8 Affordable, L.P.) — `4,786,701 / 4,227,757 ≈ 1.13`  
  (Also matches `builtfar = 1.13`.)

### 3) Assessed value per building SF (assesstot / bldgarea) — partial-sample rankings
Computed $/SF for each visible property.

#### Top 5 **highest** assessed value per SF (partial-sample)
1. **360 WEST STREET** (NY Convention Center) — `931,422,600 / 4,060,596 ≈ $229.38/SF`
2. **761 5 AVENUE** — `791,146,000 / 1,824,820 ≈ $433.55/SF`  *(note: this is actually higher than #1; ordering corrected below)*
3. **1 COLUMBUS CIRCLE** (Time Warner Center Condo) — `794,395,096 / 2,101,990 ≈ $378.02/SF`
4. **1111 AVENUE OF THE AMER** (One Bryant Park) — `787,042,350 / 2,245,112 ≈ $350.55/SF`
5. **185 GREENWICH STREET** — `1,673,531,100 / 8,966,500 ≈ $186.63/SF`

Let me restate correctly **sorted descending** (highest $/SF first), based on the computed values in the excerpt:

1. **761 5 AVENUE** — **~$433.55/SF**  
2. **1 COLUMBUS CIRCLE** — **~$378.02/SF**  
3. **1111 AVENUE OF THE AMER** — **~$350.55/SF**  
4. **500 WEST 33 STREET** — `743,665,650 / 3,224,812 ≈` **~$230.76/SF**  
5. **360 WEST STREET** — **~$229.38/SF**

#### Bottom 5 **lowest** assessed value per SF (partial-sample)
1. **180 FT WASHINGTON AVENUE** (Presbyterian Hospital) — `460,306,800 / 3,693,539 ≈ $124.62/SF`
2. **240 1 AVENUE** — `791,815,950 / 8,942,176 ≈ $88.55/SF`
3. **MAIN STREET (Roosevelt Island)** — `534,046,500 / 4,786,701 ≈ $111.56/SF`
4. **200 CENTRAL PARK WEST** (Cultural Affairs) — `474,390,000 / 1,360,264 ≈ $348.74/SF` *(this is not bottom; indicates we need full recompute table—see note below)*
5. **388 GREENWICH STREET** — `520,000,000 / 2,354,289 ≈ $220.89/SF` *(also not bottom)*

Because the excerpt is long and manual ranking is error-prone without the full dataset loaded, I will **recompute and output a clean, audited table** (with exact ordering) once you provide the full 30 records. The formulas above are correct; the partial ranking above shows why I want to run it programmatically on the complete list.

### 5) FAR utilization % — partial-sample interpretation
Since `builtfar` is already `bldgarea/lotarea`, utilization is:

- `util% = builtfar / max(commfar, residfar, facilfar) * 100`

Examples from visible records:
- **240 1 AVENUE**: `3.34 / max(0,3.44,6.5)=3.34/6.5=51.4%` → underbuilt vs facility FAR
- **111 8 AVENUE** (M1-5): `13.09 / max(5,0,6.5)=13.09/6.5=201%` → indicates the “max of comm/res/facil FAR” method can exceed 100% when the zoning FAR fields don’t align with the actual zoning context (common in PLUTO; M districts, special districts, or data nuances). I’ll still compute it exactly as requested, but I’ll flag >100% cases.

### 6) Exempt totals — partial-sample observation
Some of the largest exemptions in the visible subset:
- **185 GREENWICH STREET**: `exempttot = 1,673,531,100` (100% exempt in record)
- **360 WEST STREET**: `931,422,600` (100% exempt)
- **1111 AVE OF THE AMER**: `787,042,350` (100% exempt)
- Several Hudson Yards lots also show full exemptions.

Once all 30 are present I’ll compute:
- `sum(exempttot)`
- exempt share of total assessed
- top exempt properties ranked

### 7) Residential metrics (unitsres > 0) — partial-sample computed comparisons
Visible residential-unit properties include:

**240 1 AVENUE**
- unitsres: 8,764
- resarea: 8,367,942  
- resarea/unit: `8,367,942 / 8,764 ≈ 954.7 SF/unit`
- assesstot/unit: `791,815,950 / 8,764 ≈ $90,350 per unit`

**1 COLUMBUS CIRCLE (Time Warner Center Condo)**
- unitsres: 226
- resarea: 441,891  
- resarea/unit: `441,891 / 226 ≈ 1,955.3 SF/unit`
- assesstot/unit: `794,395,096 / 226 ≈ $3.52M per unit`

**151 EAST 58 STREET (One Beacon Court Condo)**
- unitsres: 105
- resarea: 246,927  
- resarea/unit: `246,927 / 105 ≈ 2,351.7 SF/unit`
- assesstot/unit: `506,598,307 / 105 ≈ $4.82M per unit`

**MAIN STREET (Roosevelt Island)**
- unitsres: 8,018
- resarea: 3,739,745  
- resarea/unit: `3,739,745 / 8,018 ≈ 466.4 SF/unit`
- assesstot/unit: `534,046,500 / 8,018 ≈ $66,610 per unit`

**Interpretation (from partial-sample):**
- The condo towers (Time Warner / One Beacon Court) show **very high assessed value per unit** and **very large resarea per unit**, consistent with luxury product and the fact that PLUTO condo-lot accounting can concentrate value on the condo BBL.
- The large multifamily complexes (240 1 Ave; Roosevelt Island) show **much lower assessed value per unit** and smaller-to-moderate resarea per unit, consistent with regulated/affordable or large-scale rental stock.

## What I need from you to finish the full-30 analysis
Please provide **the remaining 8 property records** (or just paste the full `properties` array). Once I have them, I will return:

1) **Total/avg/median/min/max assesstot** across all 30  
2) **Efficiency ratio for every property** + highest/lowest (with address + BBL)  
3) **$/SF table for every property** + **top 5 / bottom 5** ranked correctly  
4) **Land use grouping** (count, avg assesstot, avg bldgarea, avg numfloors) using your land use reference  
5) **Utilization % for every property** + most underbuilt + near/over limit (and I’ll flag >100% anomalies)  
6) **Total exempt**, **exempt %**, and **top exemptions** ranked  
7) Residential-unit comparisons across all qualifying properties

If you want, tell me your preferred output format: **(a) a single summary + ranked lists**, or **(b) a full table (CSV-like) plus summaries**.
