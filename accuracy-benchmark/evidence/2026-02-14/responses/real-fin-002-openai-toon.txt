## 6) Strongest balance sheet (lowest leverage)
By **debt-to-equity (lower is better)**:
1. **Costco: 0.20x** (strongest / lowest leverage)
2. Visa: 0.66x  
3. Qualcomm: 0.70x  
4. Apple: 1.34x (highest leverage among the four)

**Answer:** **Costco** has the strongest balance sheet (lowest leverage) based on provided debt and equity tags.

---

## 7) Most free cash flow
FCF (CFO − CapEx):
- **Apple: $98.767B** (highest)
- Visa: $21.577B
- Qualcomm: $12.820B
- Costco: $7.837B

**Answer:** **Apple** generates the most free cash flow.

---

## 8) Flags: concerning debt levels or negative free cash flow
**Negative free cash flow:**  
- None of the four are negative on FCF using the provided CFO and CapEx tags.

**Potential leverage concerns (relative within this set):**
- **Apple**: **Debt/Equity = 1.34x** (meaningfully more leveraged than the others). Not necessarily distressed given very large CFO/FCF, but it is the **highest balance-sheet leverage** in this group.

**Data completeness note (Costco debt):**
- Costco’s balance sheet items shown include **long-term debt (noncurrent)** but **do not show a current portion of long-term debt** (if any). So Costco’s **total debt here may be understated** vs. full 10‑K presentation, though leverage still appears low.

**Interest coverage red flag check:**
- Visa (40.7x), Costco (67.4x), Qualcomm (18.6x) are all strong.
- Apple: **coverage not computable from provided income statement fields** (interest expense not listed in the excerpt).
