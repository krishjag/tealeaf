### 8. **⚠️ Risk Assessment & Red Flags:**

**✅ NO MAJOR CONCERNS IDENTIFIED**

All four companies demonstrate strong financial health:

**Positive Indicators:**
- ✅ All companies generate **positive free cash flow**
- ✅ Interest coverage ratios are **excellent** (18.6x to 67.4x where calculable)
- ✅ All have investment-grade financial profiles
- ✅ Strong operating cash flows across the board

**Minor Observations:**
- **Apple**: Highest leverage (1.34 D/E) but offset by massive cash generation ($98.8B FCF) and $35.9B cash on hand. The company is using debt efficiently for shareholder returns ($90.7B in stock buybacks).
  
- **Visa**: Carrying $3.0B in litigation escrow (related to merchant litigation settlement), but otherwise pristine balance sheet.

- **Costco**: Most capital-intensive model due to retail operations, resulting in lower FCF relative to operating cash flow, but this is normal for the sector.

- **Qualcomm**: Healthy across all metrics with strong semiconductor industry fundamentals.

**Conclusion:** All four companies represent **strong credit quality** with no concerning debt levels or liquidity issues. Each maintains sufficient interest coverage and robust cash generation to support operations and shareholder returns.
