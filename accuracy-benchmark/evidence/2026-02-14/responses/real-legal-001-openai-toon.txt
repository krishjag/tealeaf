## 1) Time from offense date to sentencing date
- **Offense date:** 2015-05-05  
- **Sentencing date:** 2020-02-24  

Elapsed time:
- From **2015-05-05 → 2020-02-05** = **4 years 9 months**

**Total elapsed:** **4 years 9 months** (plus **19 days**).  
(If expressed approximately in months: ~**57 months** plus 19 days.)

## 3) Defense attorneys and duration on the case (months)
The defendant shows **3 attorneys** with “entered” and “withdrawn” dates:

1) **Leonie C. Dolch**
- **Entered:** 2016-03-15  
- **Withdrawn:** 2016-07-07  
- Duration: **~3 months, 22 days** ≈ **4 months** (rounded to nearest month)

2) **Ronald Gabriel Benavides**
- **Entered:** 2016-07-07  
- **Withdrawn:** 2020-03-12  
- Duration: **~3 years, 8 months, 5 days** ≈ **44 months**

3) **Jennifer A. Lohr**
- **Entered:** 2020-05-20  
- **Withdrawn:** 2025-10-02  
- Duration: **~5 years, 4 months, 12 days** ≈ **64 months**

**Total defense attorneys:** **3**

Notes:
- There is a gap between Benavides’ withdrawal (2020-03-12) and Lohr’s entry (2020-05-20) of about **2 months**.

## 4) Total docket entries per year (2016–2025) and most active year
Important limitation: the dataset states **231 docket entries**, but the prompt provides only a **partial listing** (not all 231 are visible here). I can only count **the entries shown** in the provided text.

### Counts from the entries visible in the prompt
- **2016:** 29
- **2017:** 15
- **2018:** 22
- **2019:** 29
- **2020:** 18
- **2021:** 22
- **2022:** 24
- **2023:** 18
- **2024:** 6
- **2025:** 3

**Most activity (tie, based on visible entries):** **2016 and 2019** (each **29** entries shown).

If you want the true per-year counts for all **231**, you’d need to provide the complete docketEntries list (or I can compute from the raw JSON/CSV export).

---

## 5) Appeal-related docket entries and percentage
Again, based only on the **visible docket entries**.

### Appeal-related entries (Court of Appeals / Supreme Court)
I counted entries that explicitly reference:
- “Court of Appeals” (orders, acknowledgments, transmittals, motions in COA, appeal index/record), or
- “Supreme Court” (acknowledgment, orders, decision, review, remittitur).

**Count (visible): 27 appeal-related entries**, spanning 2020–2025, including (examples):
- 2020-06-15 Order of Court of Appeals  
- 2022-06-07 Acknowledgment from Court of Appeals  
- 2022-09-30 Order of Court of Appeals (remand for supplemental motion)  
- 2024-04-25 Court of Appeals decision & order reversing  
- 2024-05-28 Acknowledgment from Supreme Court  
- 2025-06-27 Supreme Court decision filed  
- 2025-09-05 Remittitur (Petition for Review Case)

### Percentage
- **Total docket entries shown (2016–2025):** 186 (sum of the per-year counts above)
- **Appeal-related shown:** 27

**Appeal-related percentage (of shown entries):**  
27 / 186 ≈ **14.5%**

If calculated against the full docket count stated in the case (**231**), then:  
27 / 231 ≈ **11.7%** (but that assumes no additional appeal entries exist in the omitted portion).

## 6) Receivables calculations
Receivables record (single line):
- **amountDue:** 761  
- **paid:** 352  
- **balanceDue:** 0  
- **adjust:** 0  
- **docCollected:** true

Calculations:
- **Total amount due:** **$761**
- **Total paid:** **$352**
- **Remaining balance (computed):** $761 − $352 = **$409**
- **Remaining balance (as reported “probAmt”):** **$409** (matches computed)
- **Remaining balance (as reported “balanceDue”):** **$0** (this appears to be a different field meaning than “still owed”; the record also shows **probAmt 409**, which aligns with the unpaid portion)

**% collected:** $352 / $761 ≈ **46.3%**

So, financially, the record indicates **$761 assessed**, **$352 collected**, **~46.3% collected**, with **$409 not paid** (even though “balanceDue” field is 0).

## 7) Bond amount and bond-related docket entries
### Bond amount
- **Signature bond set:** **$5,000** (“with felony conds.”)

### Bond-related docket entries (shown)
1) **2016-02-11** — **Signature bond set** — **$5,000**  
   - addlTxt: “with felony conds.”
2) **2016-02-25** — **Signature bond signed** — **$5,000**  
   - addlTxt: “and filed.”
3) **2016-10-26** — **Arraignment** — “**Bond continued**.” (no amount stated here, but bond status referenced)

If you want, I can also flag any other bond mentions (e.g., modifications, revocations) if you provide the full docket list.
