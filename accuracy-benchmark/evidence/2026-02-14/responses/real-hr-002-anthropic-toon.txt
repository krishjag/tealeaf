# Workforce Analysis: 2025 JOLTS Data

## 1. Industries by Average Job Openings Rate

### Highest Average JO Rates:
1. **Accommodation and food services: 5.83%**
2. **Leisure and hospitality: 5.73%**
3. **Health care and social assistance: 5.68%**

### Lowest Average JO Rates:
1. **Construction: 2.90%**
2. **Manufacturing: 3.19%**
3. **Government: 3.41%**

**Interpretation:** Labor demand is strongest in service sectors requiring high-volume staffing (hospitality, food service, healthcare) where turnover is traditionally high. Construction and manufacturing show weaker demand, potentially reflecting economic headwinds in goods-producing sectors. The low government rate reflects typical public sector stability with less volatility in hiring needs.

## 4. Structural Comparison: Leisure & Hospitality vs Professional & Business Services

| Metric | Leisure & Hospitality | Prof & Business Svcs | Difference |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|------------|
| **JO Rate** | 5.73% | 5.39% | +0.34% |
| **Hire Rate** | 5.72% | 4.54% | +1.18% |
| **Total Sep Rate** | 5.53% | 4.57% | +0.96% |
| **Quit Rate** | 3.99% | 2.34% | +1.65% |
| **Layoff/Discharge Rate** | 1.39% | 1.99% | -0.60% |
| **Other Sep Rate** | 0.13% | 0.23% | -0.10% |

### Key Structural Differences:

**Leisure & Hospitality:**
- **High-churn, voluntary separation model** - Quits represent 72% of all separations
- Nearly identical hire and separation rates (5.72% vs 5.53%) = "revolving door" labor market
- Lower layoff rate indicates stability in available hours/positions
- Workers have high mobility and frequently change jobs voluntarily
- Typical of entry-level, part-time, seasonal workforce

**Professional & Business Services:**
- **Lower turnover, higher layoff component** - Layoffs represent 43% of separations (vs 26% for L&H)
- Lower quit rate (2.34%) suggests jobs are more "sticky" with better retention
- Higher layoff share indicates business cycle sensitivity and restructuring activity
- Slightly negative net hiring (-0.03%) suggests sector contraction/consolidation
- Reflects professional workforce with career investment and employment contracts

## 5. Construction Seasonality

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Highest hires month** | April (364,000) |
| **Lowest hires month** | March (306,000) |
| **Range (max - min)** | **58,000** |
| **Coefficient of variation** | 5.6% |

**Pattern:** Spring surge in April hiring (post-winter weather, construction season start), with trough in March. The 58,000 range represents 17% of average monthly hires, showing **moderate seasonality** despite weather-related industry characteristics.

## 6. Separation Composition by Industry

| Industry | Quit % | Layoff % | Other % | Total Sep (000s) |

| **Construction** | 43.7% | **51.2%** 🥇 | 5.1% | 4,010 |

### Key Findings:
- **Highest Quit Share:** Accommodation and food services (78.7%) - workers freely exit for better opportunities
- **Highest Layoff Share:** Construction (51.2%) - project-based work drives involuntary separations
- **Highest Other Separations:** Government (19.0%) - retirements/transfers reflect career public servants

## 7. Labor Market Tightness Indicators (Total Nonfarm)

### Job Openings Trend:
- **Annual average:** 7,243,000 openings
- **January:** 7,762,000 (peak)
- **December:** 6,542,000 (trough)
- **Decline:** -1,220,000 (-15.7% year-over-year)

### Vacancy-to-Unemployment Context:
**Note:** JOLTS data alone doesn't provide unemployment levels. However, we can assess tightness directionally:

- **Average JO rate:** 4.39% of employment
- **Downward trajectory** throughout 2025 suggests cooling labor market
- For context, a "balanced" labor market historically shows ~3.5% JO rate
- **2025 pattern:** Market started tight (4.7% in Jan) and loosened considerably (3.9% in Dec)

**Implied tightness ratio trend:** If assuming unemployment remained relatively stable, the 16% decline in openings suggests meaningful reduction in jobs-per-unemployed worker, shifting bargaining power from workers to employers as the year progressed. The ratio likely moved from above 1.0 (more openings than unemployed) toward parity or below.

## Strategic Summary

2025 showed a **bifurcated labor market:**
- **Service sectors** (healthcare, leisure, food service) remained hot with expansion and voluntary turnover
- **White-collar/goods sectors** (info, manufacturing, professional services) contracted with layoff-driven separations
- Overall market **cooled significantly** through year-end, with December showing weakest openings rate
- **Structural churn** remains highest where automation resistance is strongest (healthcare, hospitality)
