# Comprehensive JOLTS Data Analysis for 2025

## 1. Industries by Average Job Openings Rate

**Top 3 Highest:**
1. **Accommodation and food services: 5.83%** - Extreme difficulty filling front-line service positions
2. **Leisure and hospitality: 5.73%** - High turnover requires constant recruitment pipeline
3. **Health care and social assistance: 5.68%** - Critical worker shortages across clinical/care roles

**Bottom 3 Lowest:**
1. **Construction: 2.90%** - Project-based work with established contractor networks
2. **Manufacturing: 3.19%** - More stable workforce, specialized skills limit external hiring
3. **Government: 3.41%** - Structured hiring processes, competitive benefits retain workers

**Interpretation:** Service sectors face 2x the labor demand pressure of goods-producing/public sectors. This reflects fundamental differences in work conditions (wages, schedules, physicality) and workforce availability. The 2.9 percentage point gap between highest and lowest reveals severe labor market segmentation.

| 2 | Total private | 4,945.7 |
| 3 | **Professional and business services** | 1,025.8 |
| 4 | **Leisure and hospitality** | 960.4 |
| 5 | **Accommodation and food services** | 794.8 |

| 9 | Government | 333.7 |
| 10 | Manufacturing | 310.2 |
| 11 | Financial activities | 205.9 |
| 12 | **Information** | 85.9 |

**Key Insight:** The top 4 industries (excluding aggregates) account for 3,474.8K monthly churn - **70% of all workforce movement** despite representing ~40% of employment. Leisure/hospitality has 11x the churn of Information sector.

## 3. Net Hiring Rate (Growth vs. Contraction)

**GROWING Industries (Positive Net Hiring):**
- **Health care and social assistance: +0.30%** ⭐ Fastest growth
- **Leisure and hospitality: +0.19%**
- **Accommodation and food services: +0.16%**
- **Construction: +0.12%**
- **Financial activities: +0.09%**
- **Government: +0.06%**
- **Total nonfarm/Total private: +0.06%**

**SHRINKING Industries (Negative Net Hiring):**
- **Information: -0.06%** - Tech sector contraction/restructuring
- **Manufacturing: -0.04%** - Automation/efficiency gains reducing headcount
- **Professional and business services: -0.03%** - Following tech slowdown
- **Retail trade: -0.01%** - E-commerce displacement of brick-and-mortar

**Critical Finding:** Healthcare (+0.30%) is adding workers 5x faster than the national average, reflecting demographic pressures. The "knowledge economy" (Information, Professional services) is actually contracting while in-person service sectors expand.

## 4. Structural Comparison: Leisure & Hospitality vs. Professional & Business Services

| Metric | Leisure & Hospitality | Prof. & Business Services | Difference |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| **JO Rate** | 5.73% | 5.39% | +0.34 pp |
| **Hire Rate** | 5.72% | 4.54% | **+1.18 pp** |
| **Separation Rate** | 5.53% | 4.57% | **+0.96 pp** |
| **Quit Rate** | 3.99% | 2.34% | **+1.65 pp** |
| **Layoff Rate** | 1.43% | 1.99% | **-0.56 pp** |
| **Other Sep. Rate** | 0.13% | 0.23% | -0.10 pp |

### Structural Differences Revealed:

**Leisure & Hospitality = "Revolving Door" Model:**
- **70% higher voluntary turnover** (3.99% vs 2.34% quits)
- Workers cycle in/out rapidly - hire rate nearly matches separation rate
- Lower layoff rates suggest workers leave on their own terms
- Likely driven by: low wages, irregular schedules, limited advancement, young/transient workforce

**Professional & Business Services = "Restructuring Churn" Model:**
- **39% higher layoff rates** (1.99% vs 1.43%)
- Despite white-collar positions, experiencing significant involuntary separations
- Lower quit rates indicate workers prefer to stay when possible
- Reflects: project-based staffing (temp agencies), corporate restructurings, selective downsizing

**Bottom Line:** Leisure has a *retention* problem (workers choose to leave). Professional services has a *stability* problem (employers forcing exits despite lower voluntary departure).

## 5. Construction Seasonality Analysis

**Highest Hires:** April (364K)  
**Lowest Hires:** March (306K)  
**Range:** 58K (19% variation)

**Unexpected Pattern:** The low point in March followed by April surge suggests:
- Weather disruptions in early spring delay March projects
- April represents "breaking of ground" as conditions improve
- Counter-intuitively, summer months (Jun-Aug) show hiring *decline* to ~350K, possibly as projects staff up early and phase work through season

Notably, December (347K) nearly matches February (347K), suggesting year-round baseline demand with spring surge.

## 6. Separation Composition by Industry

| Industry | Quit % | Layoff % | Other % | Profile |
|----------|--------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Accommodation & food services** | **79.1%** | 18.6% | 2.3% | ⭐ Highest quit |
| Leisure & hospitality | 72.2% | 25.6% | 2.3% | Voluntary exodus |
| Health care & social | 70.2% | 23.1% | 5.4% | Burnout/turnover |
| Retail trade | 69.1% | 27.0% | 3.9% | Worker-driven exits |
| Total nonfarm | 61.1% | 32.3% | 5.7% | Benchmark |
| Total private | 61.5% | 33.8% | 4.7% | Slightly higher voluntary |
| Financial activities | 60.1% | 28.4% | 11.3% | High "other" (retirements?) |
| Manufacturing | 56.6% | 37.2% | 6.2% | Balanced |
| Government | 55.5% | 25.2% | **19.2%** | ⭐ Highest "other" |
| Professional & business | 51.5% | **43.5%** | 5.1% | Near-parity |
| Construction | 44.1% | **51.2%** | 4.5% | ⭐ Highest layoff |
| Information | 44.3% | 47.6% | 8.3% | Employer-driven |

### Key Findings:
- **Highest Quit Share:** Accommodation/food (79.1%) - workers voting with feet
- **Highest Layoff Share:** Construction (51.2%) - project completions, weather, economic sensitivity
- **Government's 19.2% "other"** reflects retirements (older workforce, pension eligibility)
- Clear divide: Service sectors = quit-driven, Tech/construction = layoff-driven

## 7. Labor Market Tightness Analysis

**Average Total Nonfarm Job Openings:** 7,243K monthly

To calculate the job openings-to-unemployment ratio (a key Fed indicator), we'd need unemployment data. However, we can contextualize:

- **Historical context:** A ratio above 1.0 indicates more openings than unemployed persons (very tight). Pre-pandemic normal was ~0.6-0.7.
- **With ~7.2M openings:** If unemployment were ~6.0M (roughly 3.7% rate), ratio would be **1.2** - indicating continued labor shortage
- **December trend:** JO dropped to 6,542K (lowest of year), down 16% from peak (7,712K in May), suggesting gradual labor market cooling

**The 2025 pattern shows:**
- Peak tightness: May (7,712K openings)
- Steady cooling: August-December decline
- Year-end level still historically elevated, but moderating from early-year highs
- This aligns with Fed goals of "soft landing" - reducing labor demand without triggering mass layoffs (separation rates remained stable)

**Industry-specific tightness** (JO rate as proxy):
- Most constrained: Service sectors (5.7-5.8%)
- Most balanced: Construction/manufacturing (2.9-3.2%)
- Government (3.4%) reflecting budget constraints on hiring

## Strategic Implications

1. **For Employers:** Service sector retention crisis requires wage/condition improvements, not just hiring
2. **For Workers:** Healthcare offers best growth opportunities; tech sector facing headwinds
3. **For Policymakers:** Labor shortage is service-specific, not economy-wide - targeted immigration/training needed
4. **Macro Trend:** 2025 showed labor market normalization without collapse - successful rebalancing
