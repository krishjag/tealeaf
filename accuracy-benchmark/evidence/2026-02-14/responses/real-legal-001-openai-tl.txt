Counted from the provided docket-entry list by the **date** field.

- **2016:** 29  
- **2017:** 10  
- **2018:** 20

### 5) Appeal-related docket entries (Court of Appeals / Supreme Court)
Counted entries whose description/additional text explicitly references **Court of Appeals**, **appeal**, **remand**, **appellate**, **Supreme Court**, **petition for review**, **remittitur**, or similar.

**Appeal-related entries identified:** **34**

**Total docket entries (all years shown):**  
29 + 10 + 20 + 15 + 18 + 18 + 24 + 21 + 6 + 3 = **164**

**Percentage appeal-related:**  
34 / 164 ≈ **20.7%**

---

### 6) Receivables: totals due/paid/balance and % collected
Receivables table contains one receivable:

Receivable fields:
- **amountDue:** 761  
- **paid:** 352  
- **balanceDue:** 0  
- **adjust:** 0  
- (probAmt 409 is listed but not needed for the requested totals)

Calculations:
- **Total amount due:** **$761.00**
- **Total paid:** **$352.00**
- **Remaining balance:** **$0.00** (as recorded)
- **% collected (paid ÷ amount due):** 352 / 761 ≈ **46.3%**

Note: The receivable shows **balanceDue = 0** despite paid being less than amountDue; that implies the remainder may have been resolved via something other than “paid” (e.g., adjustment/waiver/other accounting treatment), but **adjust = 0** is shown in the captured fields.

### 7) Bond amount + bond-related docket entries and dates
**Bond amount set:** **$5,000** (signature/recognizance bond with felony conditions)

Bond-related docket entries in the data:
1) **2016-02-11** — **“Signature bond set”** — **$5,000** (addl text: “with felony conds.”)  
2) **2016-02-25** — **“Signature bond signed”** — **$5,000** (addl text: “and filed.”)  
3) **2016-10-26** — Arraignment entry notes **“Bond continued.”** (no amount stated there, but it is bond-related procedurally)

If you want, I can also (a) list exactly which entries I counted as “appeal-related” with dates, or (b) recompute attorney durations using an exact day-count-to-months convention you specify (e.g., 30.44-day months).
