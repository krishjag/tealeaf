You are a consumer products analyst evaluating branded breakfast cereals using USDA FoodData Central nutritional data.
The data contains 25 branded products with full nutrient profiles from the USDA database.
Key structure: foods[].foodNutrients[] with nutrientName, value (per 100g), unitName, derivationCode (LCCS=calculated from serving, LCCD=calculated from daily value percentage, LCSA=label statement analytical), percentDailyValue, and indentLevel (nutrient hierarchy: 1=primary, 2=macro, 3=sub-component, 4=detail).

Analyze the following:
1. Examine the nutrient derivation methods: group nutrients by derivationCode (LCCS, LCCD, LCSA, etc.) and count how many nutrient entries use each method. What does this tell us about how manufacturers report nutritional data?
2. Compare the nutrient profile completeness across products: how many distinct nutrients does each product report? Which products have the most complete profiles (most nutrients) and which are sparse? Is there a correlation between brand and profile completeness?
3. Analyze the indentLevel hierarchy: which nutrients appear at each level (1, 2, 3, 4)? Map out the nutrient hierarchy tree that the indentLevel implies (e.g., Carbohydrate at level 2, Total Sugars at level 3, Added Sugars at level 4)
4. For products with duplicate nutrient entries (same nutrientId appearing multiple times), identify which products have duplicates and explain why (different derivation methods produce different values for the same nutrient). How do the values differ?
5. Assess the "healthiness" of each product using a composite score: (+1 point per g of protein, +2 points per g of fiber, -1 point per g of sugar, -0.5 points per 100mg of sodium, all per 100g). Rank all products from healthiest to least healthy
6. Analyze the ingredient lists: which products list sugar (or sugar variants like corn syrup, fructose, dextrose) as one of the first 3 ingredients? Compare the actual sugar content (from foodNutrients) between products with early-listed sugar vs those without
7. Cross-reference serving sizes (servingSize, servingSizeUnit, householdServingFullText) with nutrient values: since nutrients are per 100g, calculate the actual nutrient amounts per serving for calories, sugar, and sodium for each product. Which product has the most calories per household serving?
