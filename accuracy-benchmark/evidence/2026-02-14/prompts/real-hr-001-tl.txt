Perform the following calculations and analysis:
1. For each industry, calculate the average monthly job openings level and hires level for the full year
2. Compute the job openings-to-hires ratio (average JO level / average HI level) for each industry. Which industry has the highest ratio (hardest to fill positions)?
3. Calculate the quit rate minus the layoff rate (QU rate - LD rate) for each industry, averaged over the year. This measures voluntary vs involuntary turnover balance. Rank industries from highest to lowest
4. For Total nonfarm, compute the month-over-month change in job openings level for each month. In which month was the largest increase? The largest decrease?
5. Calculate total separations as the sum of quits + layoffs + other separations (using levels) for each industry. Verify this matches the reported TS level within rounding
6. Which industry has the highest average quit rate? Which has the highest average layoff rate?
7. Compare the private sector (Total private) to Government: which has higher hire rates, quit rates, and layoff rates on average?
